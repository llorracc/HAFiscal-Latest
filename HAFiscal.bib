  abstract	= {Abstract We investigate how households in temporarily
		  straitened circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut
		  back on expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of
		  unemployment insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and
		  empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for
		  the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable
		  goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run
		  households can cut back significantly on total expenditures
		  without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate
		  their budget reductions on durables. We then present an
		  empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers
		  who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the
		  unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
		  show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
		  expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
		  expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
		  expenditures may be non-separable from employment status.
		  The effects we find are particularly strong for households
		  with no liquid assets before the spell started. These
		  qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the
		  theoretical predictions. (JEL: D11, D12, D91, J65)},

		  Inspired by many countries' fiscal policy responses to the

		  presence, however, the existence of DNWR reduces the
		  multiplier at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly

		  large average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in
		  heterogeneous agent models? Through a systematic
		  investigation of models with different preferences,
		  dimensions of ex-ante heterogeneity, income processes and
		  asset structure, we show that the most important factor is
		  the share and type of hand-to-mouth households. One-asset
		  models either feature a trade-off between a high average
		  MPC and a realistic level of aggregate wealth, or generate
		  an excessively polarized wealth distribution that vastly
		  understates the wealth held by households in the middle of
		  the distribution. Two-asset models that include both liquid
		  and illiquid assets can resolve this tension with a large
		  enough gap between liquid and illiquid returns. We discuss
		  how such return differential can be justified from the
		  perspective of theory and data.},

  abstract	= {We develop a novel medium-scale DSGE model, called NORA,
		  for fiscal policy analysis in Norway. NORA contains a
		  sheltered and exposed sector allowing us to model wage
		  bargaining between a labor union and the exposed sector,
		  reflecting Scandinavian wage formation institutions. Wages
		  are subject to a downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR).
		  Inspired by many countries' fiscal policy responses to the
		  Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
		  investigate the model's ability to generate state-dependent
		  fiscal multipliers. We find, that both the zero lower bound
		  on nominal interest rates and DNWR individually can account
		  for higher fiscal multipliers during recessions. In joint
		  presence, however, the existence of DNWR reduces the
		  multiplier at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly
		  relaxes the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
		  state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions about
		  the origin of the recession, the nature of the fiscal
		  stimulus and its financing source.},

  abstract	= {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much,
		  household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity
		  amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on
		  the US Great Recession of 2007–09 and proceed in two
		  steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income
		  Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income,
		  consumption, and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (ie, they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},
