  abstract	= {Abstract We investigate how households in temporarily
		  straitened circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut
		  back on expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of
		  unemployment insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and
		  empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for
		  the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable
		  goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run
		  households can cut back significantly on total expenditures
		  without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate
		  their budget reductions on durables. We then present an
		  empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers
		  who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the
		  unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
		  show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
		  expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
		  expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
		  expenditures may be non-separable from employment status.
		  The effects we find are particularly strong for households
		  with no liquid assets before the spell started. These
		  qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the
		  theoretical predictions. (JEL: D11, D12, D91, J65)},

		  evidence on household income dynamics, we show that a
		  modest degree of heterogeneity in household preferences or
		  beliefs is sufficient to match empirical measures of wealth
		  inequality in the United States. The
		  heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are consistent
		  with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the annual
		  marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
		  the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic
		  models (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high
		  MPC arises because many consumers hold little wealth
		  despite having a strong precautionary motive. Our model
		  also plausibly predicts that the aggregate MPC can differ
		  greatly depending on how the shock is distributed across
		  households (depending, e.g., on their wealth, or employment
		  status).},

		  consumption, and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (ie, they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},
