		  in the year of winning and gradually reverts to normal
		  within five years. Controlling for all items on households'
		  balance sheets and characteristics such as education and
		  income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that
		  vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the
		  smallest prizes (around US\$1,500) are estimated to spend
		  all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate
		  for high-liquidity winners of large prizes
		  (US\$8,300–150,000) is slightly below one-half. While
		  conventional models will struggle to account for such high
		  MPC levels, we show that a two-asset life cycle model with
		  a realistic earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive
