               consumption mistakes (in response to saving changes) lead to
               higher current marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). These
               mistakes increase the value of changing current consumption
               relative to changing saving, as additional saving will not be
               spent optimally. Various behavioral biases can cause these
               mistakes, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic
               expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This
               result helps explain the empirical puzzle of high-liquidity
               consumersâ€™ high MPCs. In my approach, predictions of
               sophistication (anticipation of future mistakes) can be derived
               independently of the underlying biases. (JEL D15, D91, E21)",
