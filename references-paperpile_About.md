# What is `references-paperpile.bib`?

In CDC's paperpile Pro account, a workflow has been set up from the 
HAFiscal folder, whose contents should be in sync with the contents
of the shared HAFiscal library. That library has been "shared" to 
the gmail addresses of all collaborators on the HAFiscal paper. 
This means that any of the collaborators can adjust any of the references
in the shared HAFiscal library and those should sync to everyone.

Note:
- If somebody adds something new to the HAFiscal library, it seems 
that it will be necessary to manually copy it to the HAFiscal folder
- Tags on items in a Library do not sync between shared users
