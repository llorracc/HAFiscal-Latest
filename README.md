# Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies

## Abstract

Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics over four years following an income shock (Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021)), we assess the effectiveness of three fiscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions. Unemployment insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck” winner, especially when effectiveness is measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are second best and have the advantage (over UI) of being scalable to any desired size. A temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less effective than the other policies and has negligible effects in the version of our model without a multiplier.

## Replication Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for reproducibility)
**Requirements**: Docker Engine 20.10.0+ (tested on 28.1.1), 32GB RAM recommended

```bash
# Build and run with Docker (with memory limits)
docker build -t hafiscal .
docker run -it --rm --memory=32g --memory-reservation=16g -v $(pwd):/home/hafiscal/hafiscal hafiscal

# Or with docker-compose (includes memory limits)
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec hafiscal bash

# Inside container, run any of the reproduction commands below
```

### Option 2: Native Unix Installation
**Requirements**: Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, BSD)

```bash
# Quick setup
./deps/setup.sh
conda activate hafiscal

# Then run any of the reproduction commands below
```

## Reproduction Commands

To reproduce all the computational results of the paper (several days):

```
    /bin/bash reproduce/reproduce_computed.sh
```

To produce pdf version of the paper:

```
    /bin/bash reproduce/reproduce_document.sh
```

To reproduce both computational results and the paper:

```
    /bin/bash reproduce.sh
```

To run a cut-down version of the results (<1 hour):

```
   /bin/bash reproduce_min.sh
```

Some of the statistics hard coded into the reproduce_computed.sh script are calculated using Stata. To reproduce these statistics, run the following do file in Stata:

```
Code/Empirical/make_liquid_wealth.do
```

## Step-by-step replication of computational results

Given the time it takes to replicate all the computational results in the paper, it could be useful to do them step-by-step. To do so, navigate to the directory `Code/Ha-Models` and set the appropriate flags in the file `do_all.py` for the steps to be executed. Then execute the command:  

```
python do_all.py
```

See **Runtime Requirements** below for estimates of the execution time of each step. 

**NOTE**: Our code using optimization routines should be deterministic. However, small differences in environments may lead to numerical differences in the results obtained. Such differences in steps 1 and 2 will lead to numerical differences in the results obtained in later steps as well. 

## Data Availability and Provenance Statements

The data used is saved in the replication packages and is below, along with how to find it publically:

- **Code/Empirical/rscfp2004.dta**: The summary extract data for SCF 2004 in Stata format. 

- **Code/Empirical/rscfp2004.csv**: The summary extract data for SCF 2004 in csv format. 

- **Code/Empirical/ccbal_answer.dta**: Small file created from the full public data set (main survey data) in Stata format. 

- **Code/Empirical/ccbal_answer.csv**: Small file created from the full public data set (main survey data) in csv format. 

The data is also available from the website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at this link:

[Federal Reserve Board - 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scf_2004.htm)

Download and unzip the following files to reproduce our results:

- Main survey data: Stata version - **scf2004s.zip** $\Rightarrow$ **p04i6.dta**

- Summary Extract Data set: Stata format - **scfp2004s.zip** $\Rightarrow$ **rscfp2004.dta**

Place these .dta files in the same directory as **make_liquid_wealth.do** before running the file.

**Note**: When releasing new waves of the SCF, the summary extract data for older versions are inflation-adjusted. At the time of writing, downloading the data gives a file where all dollar variables are inflation-adjusted to 2022 dollars. With an adjusted version of **rscfp2004.dta** the numbers that are in dollar amounts will not replicate the numbers used in the paper (this applies to line 2 of Table 2, Panel B). 

### Summary of Availability

- All data **are** publicly available.

## Computational requirements

A current (2025) laptop or equivalent is sufficient to reproduce the results. 

### Software Requirements

- **Stata** (code was last run with version MP/18.0, but older versions should be fine too)

- **Python 3.11.7** with the following packages:
  - econ-ark=0.15.1
  - numpy=1.26.4, matplotlib=3.8.0, scipy=1.11.4, pandas=2.1.4
  - numba=0.59.0, sequence-jacobian

- **LaTeX distribution** (TeX Live 2023+ or MiKTeX) with required packages

**Quick Setup**: Run `./deps/setup.sh` for automated dependency installation.

**Detailed Requirements**: See `deps/` directory for complete dependency specifications.

### Runtime Requirements

The full results take several days to reproduce on a modern laptop. We recommend running the code in the 5 steps which can be found in:

`Code/HA-Models/do_all.py'

On a Windows 11 laptop with 32 gb RAM and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS 3.30 GHz processor the timings were approximately as follows

- Step 1: Runtime about 20 minutes

- Step 2: Runtime about 21 hours (~7 hours per education group)

- Step 3: Similar to Step 2

- Step 4: Runtime about 1 hour

- Step 5: Runtime about 65 hours
