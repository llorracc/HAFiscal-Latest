                  (iMPCs) from an unex- pected fiscal transfer using both
                  administrative and survey data for the same households.
                  Leveraging random assignment from a tax lottery, we identify
                  large causal effects of the income windfall, tracking iMPCs
                  for eight months. Revealed-preference estimates from
                  expenditure data align with reported-preference survey results
                  for the same households, underscoring the validity of our data
                  and methods. We observe substantial heterogeneity in MPCs and
                  relate it to observable household characteristics. Households
                  report a higher MPC for unexpected income losses compared to
                  gains and prioritize debt repayment.",
