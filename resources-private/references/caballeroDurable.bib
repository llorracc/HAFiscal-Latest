  abstract  = "Aggregate expenditure on durable goods responds too slowly to
               wealth and other aggregate innovations to be consistent with the
               simplest frictionless version of PIH (permanent income
               hypothesis). In this paper I present a model of aggregate
               expenditure on durab1es that builds up from the lumpy nature of
               microeconomic purchases, and provide evidence supporting its
               contribution to the resolution of the ?slowness? puzzle. The
               paper also contains several new results on the problem of dynamic
               aggregation of stochastically heterogeneous units. In particular,
               I provide a simple characterization of the effects of
               heterogeneity and microeconomic lumpiness on aggregate dynamics.",
