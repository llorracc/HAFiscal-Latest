  abstract = "The standard model of permanent and transitory income is known to
              be misspecified. Estimates of income volatility in the model
              differ depending on the type of data moments used--levels or
              differences--and how these moments are weighted in the estimation.
              We propose two changes to the standard model. First, we account
              for the time-aggregated nature of observed income data. Second, we
              allow transitory shocks to persist for varying lengths of time.
              With only one additional parameter, our proposed model
              consistently recover the parameters of the income process
              irrespective of the estimation method. To the extent that
              researchers employ the standard model, we advise special caution
              with the use of first-difference moments.",
