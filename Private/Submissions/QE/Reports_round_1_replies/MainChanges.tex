\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Splurge}
	\item \textbf{Welfare Measure} We have completely overhauled our section on welfare and have introduced a new measure that we think best captures the idea that we want to measure welfare gains from carrying out each policy during a recession, but give no benefit in normal times to policies that in our model would increase welfare through redistribution. 
	
	Our welfare measure weights the felicity of a household at time $t$ by the marginal utility of the same household in a counterfactual simulation in which neither the recession occurred nor the fiscal policy was implemented. This weighting scheme means that in normal times the marginal benefit to a social planner of moving a dollar of consumption from one household at one time period to another household at the same or different time period is zero. Hence, in normal times, any re-distributive policy has zero marginal benefit. However, in a recession when the average marginal utility is higher than in normal times, there can be welfare benefits to government borrowing to allow households to consume more during the recession.
	
	Our new welfare measure leads to the same qualitative conclusions as in the previous version of the paper. It improves on the previous measure in several ways:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The new measure does not scale with the size of the fiscal stimulus. We divide by the net present value of the fiscal policy so the measure is a `bang-bang-for-the-buck' measure. As pointed out by referee 2, our previous measure was biased by the change in the size of the UI extension policy in a recession relative to normal times.
		\item Our new measure more naturally removes the bias to policies that redistribute from high to low-marginal utility households in normal times. Previously, we took away the welfare benefit in normal times of each policy. In our new measure, ANY marginal redistributive policy has no welfare benefit in normal times.
		\item One benefit of removing the splurge from our household behavior is that our welfare measure now matches with the utility function in the households' optimization problem.
