	\subsection{Estimation of the "splurge" factor}
	
	We defining splurging as the free spending of available income without concern for intertemporal maximization of utility. As we will show in this section, a model allowing for splurging performs well at capturing the shorter and longer term response of consumption to income shocks. Specifically, we use the results of	\citet{fagereng_mpc_2021} for the estimation of the splurge factor. The study provides empirical estimates for the aggregate marginal propensity to consume out of unexpected and transitory income shocks. [TO DO: Describe study further]\\
	\\	
	We estimate the splurge factor, the mean discount rate across the population as well as its spread to match two empirical moments. 
	
	First, we match the steady-state distribution of liquid wealth in the model to its empirical counterpart. Due to the lack of data on the liquid wealth distribution in Norway, we resort to the corresponding data from the US - assuming that liquid wealth inequality is comparable across these countries. Specifically, we impose as targets the cummulative liquid wealth share at the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th income percentile, which equal 0\%, 0.4\%, 2.5\% and 11.7\%.\footnote{@Edmund, where is this data from?} Hence, 87.3\% of the total liquid wealth is  held by the top income quintile. The data is plotted in figure \ref{fig:liquwealthdistribution}.


	Second, we take from \citet{fagereng_mpc_2021} the marginal propensity to consume out of a one-period income shock. We not only target the contemporaneous respone of consumption to the income shock, but also the subsequent impact on consumption in years one to four after the income shock. The MPCs from \citet{fagereng_mpc_2021} are plotted in figure \ref{fig:aggmpclotterywin}.

\end{figure}


	The model is calibrated to reflect the Norwegian economy. Specifically, we set the real interest rate to 2\% annually and the unemployment rate to 4.4\%, in line with \citet{aursland_state-dependent_2020}. The quartarly probability to survive is calibrated to $1-1/160$, reflecting an expected working life of 40 years. Aggregate productivity growth is set to 1\% annually following \citet{kravik_navigating_2019}. The unemployment net replacement rent is calibrated to 60\% following \citet{oecd_net_2020}. Finally, we set the real interest rate on liquid debt to 13.6\% and the borrowing constraint on 80\% of permanent income following data from the Norwegian debt registry \citet{gjeldsregistret_nokkeltall_2022}.\footnote{Specifically, we determine the average volume-weighted interest rate on liquid debt, which consists of consumer loans, credit and payment card debt and all other unsecured debt. To determine the borrowing limit on liquid debt we determine the ratio between total credit card limit divided by total wage income in Norway. We use data from December 2019.} The standard deviation of the permanent and transitory shock are 0.005 and 0.12, respectively. [TO DO: Explain origin of these numbers]
	
	The estimation procedure minimizes the distance between targets and model moments for a splurge of 0.32, a beta of 0.986 and a nabla of 0.0174. The model is able to replicate the aggregate marginal propensity to consume from \citet{fagereng_mpc_2021} very well and the targeted distribution of liquid wealth, see figure \ref{fig:splurge_estimation}.


	
	\section{Fiscal policy simulations}
	
	We consider the following fiscal policy experiments
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Payroll tax cut: Employed individuals benefit from a 2 percentage points lower payroll tax cut. The tax cut is unanticipated and usually lasts for 8 quarters. However, there is a 50\% chance, that the policy is extended by another 8 quarters if the recession is still ongoing in the 8th quarter of the payroll tax cut. 
		\item Unemployment insurance extension: The duration of the unemployment insurance is doubled from 2 to 4 quarters. Agents, that are unemployed when the policy is implemented thus receive up to 4 quarters of unemployment insurance. The policy is unanticipated and active only for one quarter.
		\item Stimulus check: Each individual, independent of employment status, receives an unanticipated payment of \$1200 in one quarter. However, the check is only paid out fully to individuals with a permanent yearly income smaller than 100,000 and not at all to those with a income greater than 150,000. Those within the two thressholds receive a share of the full stimulus check amount proportionate to their position within threshholds.\footnote{For this income group, the check amount is given by $\$1200 (1-\frac{Income-100,000}{50,000})$. For example, an individual with a permanent yearly income of 110,000 receives 80\% of the stimulus, i.e. \$960.}

	\subsection{Multipliers}
	
	Definitions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textit{net present value (NPV)} of a variable X at horizon t is given by
		\begin{equation}
			NPV(t,X) = \sum_{s=0}^{t} \left( \prod_{i=1}^{s} \frac{1}{R_i} \right) X_s
		\end{equation}
		\item The \textit{cummulative multiplier (CM)} of a policy is given by
		\begin{equation}
			CM(t) = \frac{NPV(t,\Delta C)}{NPV (T_{max},\Delta G)}
		\end{equation}
		where $\Delta C$ is the additional aggregate consumption spending in the policy scenario relative to the baseline and $\Delta G$ is the government expenditures caused by the policy.

	\section{Welfare analysis}
	
	We want to convert welfare units to consumption units. A proportional increase in every agents' consumption in the baseline by fraction $x$, in welfare, is equal to:
	\begin{align}
	x\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} D^t c_{it,\text{base}} u'(c_{it,\text{base}})
	\end{align}
	where $c_{it}$ is consumption (including the splurge) of agent $i$ at time $t$ and $D$ is the social planner's discount rate. $N$ is the number of agents.
	
	
	The cost of such an increase is
	\begin{align}
	x\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} R^{-t} c_{it,\text{base}}
	\end{align}
	Define
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{W}^c =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} D^t c_{it,\text{base}} u'(c_{it,\text{base}}) \\
	\mathcal{P}^c = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} R^{-t} c_{it,\text{base}}
	\end{align}
	Aside - with log utility, $\mathcal{W}^c =\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} D^t = \frac{1}{1-D}$
	
	We will assume that a government expenditure of size $F$ with welfare benefit $\mathcal{W}$ will be funded by a proportional consumption tax of size $\frac{F}{\mathcal{P}^c}$ resulting in a welfare loss of $\frac{F}{\mathcal{P}^c}\mathcal{W}^c$. The overall welfare benefit will be equivalent to consumption units:
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{C} = \frac{\mathcal{W}}{\mathcal{W}^c} - \frac{F}{\mathcal{P}^c}
	\end{align}
	There is also an `unseen' cost to the government policy exactly equal to implementing the policy in normal times.
	
	Define welfare of a policy as:
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{W}(\text{policy},AD,Rec) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} D^t u(c_{it,\text{policy},AD,Rec})
	\end{align}
	
	So the consumption equivalent of a policy implemented in recession is:
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{C}(\text{policy},AD,Rec) &= \bigg(\frac{\mathcal{W}(\text{policy},AD,Rec)-\mathcal{W}(AD,Rec)}{\mathcal{W}^c} - \frac{PV(\text{policy},Rec)}{\mathcal{P}^c} \bigg)\\ \nonumber
	& \qquad -
	\bigg(\frac{\mathcal{W}(\text{policy}) - \mathcal{W}(\text{base})}{\mathcal{W}^c} - \frac{PV(\text{policy})}{\mathcal{P}^c} \bigg)
	\end{align}
	
	\begin{table} 
		\center
		\input ../Code/HA-Models/FromPandemicCode/Tables/welfare4.tex
		\caption{Consumption Equivalent Welfare Gains in Basis Points }
		\label{welfare}
	\end{table}
	
	Table \ref{welfare} shows results for this method. Note that the policy expenditures of each policy have been equalized.
