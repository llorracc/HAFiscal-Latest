Splurge consumption

▶ Exogenous fraction of income directly consumed
▶ Model consistent with spending patterns over time after a transitory income shock
▶ Evidence: High liquid wealth hh also have high MPCs
▶ Kueng (2018); Crawley and Kuchler (2023); Graham and McDowall (2024)

▶ Possible microfoundations:
▶ Spending on durables (Browning and Crossley, 2009; Laibson et al., 2022)
▶ A form of present bias (Indarte et al., 2024, Maxted et al., 2024)

▶ Robustness: Model w/o splurge consumption

Employment status and recessions

▶ Emplyoment status is subject to a Markov process
▶ Employed consumer: continue being employed or become unemployed
▶ Unemployed consumers: receives benefits for two quarters

▶ Bureau of Labor Statistics: Report unemployment rates by education group
▶ Recession is given by an MIT shock
▶ Unemployment rate doubles in each education group
▶ Expected length of unemployment increases from 2 to 4q
▶ End of recession occurs as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an avg. rec. length of 6q

Robustness: Multipliers in a HANK and SAM model — Setup
▶ Evaluate the policies in a relatively standard HANK and SAM model (Du, 2024)
▶ New Keynesian: Monopolistic competition + sticky prices
▶ Search and matching: Random search, labor market tightness affects job finding
and vacancy filling probabilities
▶ Government policy: Monetary and fiscal rules
▶ Fiscal multipliers through an intertemporal Keynesian cross mechanism
However: No state dependence
▶ Solution method ⇒ cannot evaluate effects starting in a deep recessionary state
This also implies that we cannot use our welfare measure
