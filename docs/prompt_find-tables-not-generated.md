_**Assistant**_

I'll help you execute this prompt to find tables referenced in LaTeX files that don't have corresponding creation code. Let me break this down into steps.

First, I'll search for LaTeX files and their table references.

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "\\begin{table}|\\input.*table|\\include.*table" • **12** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
...
</details>

---

Let me analyze these results and extract the unique table names, excluding commented lines and private files. I'll then search for their creation code.

Here are the unique tables I've identified that need to be checked for creation code:

1. Table_EstimationResults
2. Table_MPCbyLiquWealth
3. Table_MPCbyLiquWealth_DataOnly
4. Table_MPCbyLiquWealth_comparison_splurge0
5. Table_UnempSpell_Dynamics
6. Table_Multipliers
7. Table_Multipliers_withHank
8. Table_Multipliers_SplurgeComp
9. Table_UIextension_CompSplurge0
10. Table_HANK_multipliers
11. Table_LiquWealth_Distribution
12. Table_LiquWealth_Distribution_comparison_splurge0
13. Table_EstimationResults_robustness
14. Table_EstimationResults_CRRA_2.0_R_1.01_wSplZero

Let me search for the creation code for these tables in Python files and Jupyter notebooks.

|------|------|-------|

</details>

Let me analyze the results and provide a summary of tables that don't have clear creation code:

1. Tables with creation code found:
- Table_EstimationResults (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_MPCbyLiquWealth (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_MPCbyLiquWealth_DataOnly (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_MPCbyLiquWealth_comparison_splurge0 (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_UnempSpell_Dynamics (EvalConsDropUponUILeave.py)
- Table_Multipliers (Output_Results.py)
- Table_Multipliers_withHank (Output_Results.py)
- Table_Multipliers_SplurgeComp (Output_Results.py)
- Table_UIextension_CompSplurge0 (EvalConsDropUponUILeave.py)
- Table_HANK_multipliers (HA-Fiscal-HANK-SAM-to-python.py)
- Table_LiquWealth_Distribution (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_LiquWealth_Distribution_comparison_splurge0 (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_EstimationResults_robustness (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)
- Table_EstimationResults_CRRA_2.0_R_1.01_wSplZero (Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py)

2. Tables with no clear creation code found:
None - all tables appear to have corresponding creation code in either Python files or Jupyter notebooks.

3. The creation code is spread across several files:
   - Estimation_BetaNablaSplurge.py for estimation results and MPC related tables
   - Output_Results.py for multiplier related tables
   - EvalConsDropUponUILeave.py for unemployment spell dynamics tables
   - HA-Fiscal-HANK-SAM-to-python.py for HANK model related tables

Would you like me to provide more details about any specific table or its creation code?

_**User**_

Are the jupyter notebooks executed by the logic of the reproduce.sh script?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the reproduce.sh script to see if it executes the Jupyter notebooks.


---

Read file: reproduce.sh

---

Let me check the reproduce_computed.sh script since that seems to be the main script for reproducing computational results.



---

Read file: reproduce/reproduce_computed.sh

---

No, the jupyter notebooks are not executed by the reproduce.sh script
