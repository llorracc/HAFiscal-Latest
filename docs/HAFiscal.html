<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="abstract"></a> Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics over
four years following an income shock (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)), we assess
the eﬀectiveness of three ﬁscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions.
Unemployment insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck” winner when
eﬀectiveness is measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are second best and have two
advantages (over UI): they arrive faster, and they are scalable to any desired size. A
temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less eﬀective than
the other policies and has negligible eﬀects in the version of our model without a
multiplier.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Fiscal policies that aim to boost consumer spending in recessions have been tried in many
countries in recent decades. The nature of such policies has varied widely, perhaps because
traditional macroeconomic models have not provided plausible guidance about which policies
are likely to be most eﬀective—either in reducing misery (a ‘welfare metric’) or in increasing
output (a ‘GDP metric’).
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  But a new generation of macro models has shown that when microeconomic heterogeneity
across consumer circumstances (wealth; income; education) is taken into account, the
consequences of an income shock for consumer spending depend on a measurable object: the
intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (IMPC) introduced in <a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">Auclert, Rognlie, and
Straub</a> (<a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">2018</a>). The IMPC extends the notion of marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
to account for the speed at which households spend. Fortuitously, new sources of
microeconomic data, particularly from Scandinavian national registries, have recently
allowed the ﬁrst high-quality measurements of the IMPC (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Even in models that can match a given measured IMPC pattern, the relative merits of
alternative policies depend profoundly both on the metric (welfare or GDP) and on the
quantitative structure of the rest of the model – for example, whether multipliers exist and
how they work. Here, after constructing a microeconomically credible heterogeneous agent
(HA) model, we examine its implications for how optimal stimulus policies depend on
the existence, nature, and timing of any “multipliers,” which, following <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger,
Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>), we model in a clean and simple way. As a result, the
interaction of the multiplier (if any) with the other elements of the model is reasonably
easy to understand. In order to ease interpretation of our results, as well as to keep
the model tractable, our primary analysis is based on an aggregation of individual
consumption responses. This partial equilibrium analysis allows us to introduce
elements such as the fact that our multiplier only acts during a recession. However, a
general equilibrium approach may introduce transmission channels that we miss
in our primary analysis. Accordingly, we also analyze a simple HANK and SAM
model that embeds our households’ consumption responses in a general equilibrium
framework.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-1" id="enmark-1"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">1</span></a></sup>
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="microeconomically-credible"></a> By “microeconomically credible,” we mean a model that can match three things that
we take to be stylized facts: (1) the measured IMPCs from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), (2) the cross-sectional distribution of liquid wealth (following <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and
Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>)’s deﬁnition of liquid wealth) and (3) the spending induced by the
unanticipated transitory shock is “front-loaded.” <a 
 id="likesection.1"></a><a 
 id="x1-1001x1"></a><a 
 id="splurge"></a> What we mean by this is that a
fairly standard HA model (speciﬁcally, the model in <a 
href="#XcstwMPC">Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and
White</a> (<a 
href="#XcstwMPC">2017</a>)) can match both the initial distribution of liquid wealth, and the pattern of
spending in periods after the shock arrives. But the prediction of that model for
spending in the initial period is below the actual spending measured. We call the
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
extra spending that happens immediately in the period of receipt of the stimulus a
“splurge.”
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  Our splurge behavior is common across households and independent of their liquid wealth
holdings, consistent with the emerging literature showing that even high-wealth households
seem to have a high ‘initial MPC’ out of income shocks.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-2" id="enmark-2"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">2</span></a></sup>
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  The evidence of front-loading from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>) is consistent with
ﬁndings elsewhere in the literature; perhaps the closest direct comparison is to a recent paper
by
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >  <sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-3" id="enmark-3"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">3</span></a></sup> This ‘splurge’ model is also consistent with evidence, from <a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">Ganong and Noel</a> (<a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">2019</a>), that
spending drops sharply following the large and predictable drop in income after the exhaustion
of unemployment beneﬁts.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-4" id="enmark-4"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">4</span></a></sup>
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  The resulting structural model could be used to evaluate a wide variety of consumption
stimulus policies. We examine three that have been implemented in recent recessions in the
United States (and elsewhere): an extension of unemployment insurance (UI) beneﬁts, a
means-tested stimulus check, and a payroll tax cut.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  Our ﬁrst metric of policy eﬀectiveness is “multiplication bang for the buck”: For a dollar of
spending on a particular policy, how much multiplication is induced? Timing matters because
in our model (following the empirical literature), the size of any “consumption multiplier”
depends on the economic conditions that prevail when the extra spending occurs. Our strategy
to illuminate this point is twofold. First, we calculate the policy-induced spending dynamics in
an economy with no multiplier (and, therefore, with no multiplication-bang-for-the-buck).
We then follow <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>)’s approach to modeling the
aggregate demand externality. In their approach, output depends mechanically on the
level of consumption relative to steady state. But in contrast to <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman,
and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>), the aggregate demand externality in our model is switched on
only when the economy is experiencing a recession—there is no multiplication for
spending that occurs after our simulated recession is over. A less stark assumption
(for example, the degree of multiplication depends on the distance of the economy
from its steady state, or the endogenous time-varying multiplication that arises in a
New-Keynesian model) would perhaps be more realistic but also much harder to assess
clearly.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  Because our model’s outcomes reﬂect the behavior of utility-maximizing consumers, we can
calculate another, possibly more interesting, measure of the eﬀectiveness of alternative
policies: their eﬀect on consumers’ welfare. Even without multiplication, a utility-based metric
can justify countercyclical policy because the larger idiosyncratic shocks to income that occur
during a recession may justify a greater-than-normal degree of social insurance. We call this
‘welfare bang for the buck.’
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  The principal diﬀerence between the two metrics is that what matters for the degree of
spending multiplication is how much of the policy-induced extra spending occurs during the
recession (when the multiplier matters), while eﬀectiveness in the utility metric also depends
on who is doing the extra spending (because the recession hits some households much harder
than others).
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >  Because high-MPC consumers have high marginal utility, a standard aggregated
welfare function would favor redistribution to such consumers even in the absence of
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
a recession. We are interested in the degree of <span 
class="ecti-1200">extra </span>motivation for redistributive
policies present in a recession, so we construct our social welfare metric speciﬁcally to
measure only the <span 
class="ecti-1200">incremental </span>social welfare eﬀect of alternative policies during
recessions (beyond whatever redistributional logic might apply during expansions – see
section <a 
href="#x1-270004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a>).
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  Households do not prepare for our “MIT shock” recessions, which double the unemployment
rate and the average length of unemployment spells. The end of the recession occurs
as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an average recession length of six quarters,
leading to a return of the unemployment rate to normal levels over time. When the
multiplier is active, any reduction in aggregate consumption below its steady-state level
directly reduces aggregate productivity and thus labor income. Hence, any policy
stimulating consumption will also boost incomes through this aggregate demand multiplier
channel.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  Our results are intuitive. In the economy with no recession multiplier, the beneﬁt of a
sustained payroll tax cut is negligible.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-5" id="enmark-5"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">5</span></a></sup> When a multiplier exists, the tax cut has more
beneﬁts, especially if the recession continues long enough that most of the spending induced
by the tax cut happens while the economy is still in recession (and the multiplier
still is in force). The typical recession, however, ends long before our “sustained”
wage tax cut is reversed—and even longer before lower-MPC consumers have spent
down most of their extra after-tax income. Accordingly, even in an economy with a
multiplier that is powerful during recessions, much of the wage tax cut’s eﬀect on
consumption occurs when any multiplier that might have existed in a recession is no longer
operative.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  Even leaving aside any multiplier eﬀects, the stimulus checks have more value than the wage
tax cut, because at least a portion of such checks go to unemployed people who have both high
MPCs and high marginal utilities (while wage tax cuts, by deﬁnition, go only to persons who
are employed and earning wages). The greatest “welfare bang for the buck” comes from
the UI insurance extension, because many of the recipients are in circumstances in
which they have a much higher marginal utility than they would have had in the
absence of the recession, whether or not the multiplier aggregate demand externality
exists.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >  And, in contrast to the wage-tax cut, both the UI extension and the stimulus checks
concentrate most of the marginal increment to consumption at times when the multiplier (if it
exists) is still powerful. A disadvantage of the UI extension, in terms of “multiplied
bang for the buck,” is that (relative to the assumed-to-be-immediate-upon-recession
checks) it takes somewhat more time until the transfers reach the beneﬁciaries.
Countering this disadvantage is the fact that the MPC of UI recipients is higher
than that of stimulus check recipients, and, furthermore, the insurance nature of
the UI payments reduces the precautionary saving motive. In the end, our model
says that these two forces roughly balance each other, so that the “multiplied bang
for the buck” of the two policies is similar. In the welfare metric, however, there is
considerable marginal value to UI recipients even if they receive some of the beneﬁts after
the recession is over (and no multiplier exists). Hence, in the welfare metric, the
relative value of UI beneﬁts is increased compared with the policy of sending stimulus
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
checks.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  We conclude that extended UI beneﬁts should be the ﬁrst weapon employed from this
arsenal, as they have a greater welfare beneﬁt than stimulus checks and a similar “multiplied
bang for the buck.” But a disadvantage is that the total amount of stimulus that can be
accomplished with the UI extension is constrained by the fact that only a limited
number of people become unemployed. If more stimulation is called for than can be
accomplished via the UI extension, checks have the advantage that their eﬀects scale almost
linearly in the size of the stimulus—see <a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">Beraja and Zorzi</a> (<a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">2023</a>) for a more detailed
exposition of the relation between MPC and stimulus size. The wage tax cut is also, in
principle, scalable, but its eﬀects are smaller than those of checks because recipients
have lower MPCs and marginal utility than check and UI recipients. In the real
world, a tax cut is also likely the least ﬂexible of the three tools: UI beneﬁts can be
further extended, and multiple rounds of checks can be sent, but multiple rounds of
changes in payroll tax rates would likely be administratively and politically more
diﬃcult.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >  One theme of our paper is that which policies are better or worse, and by how much,
depends on both the quantitative details of the policies and the quantitative modeling of the
economy.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >  But the tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of
other policies. For example, in the COVID-19 recession in the US, not only was the
duration of UI beneﬁts extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by
substantial extra payments to every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model
to match this particular policy, but the framework could accommodate such an
analysis.

<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Several papers have looked at ﬁscal policies that have been implemented in the U.S. under the
lens of a structural model. <a 
href="#Xcoenen2012effects">Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof, Lalonde,
Laxton, Lindé, Mourougane, Muir, et al.</a> (<a 
href="#Xcoenen2012effects">2012</a>) analyses the eﬀects of diﬀerent
ﬁscal policies using seven diﬀerent models. The models are variants of two-agent
heterogeneous agent models and make no attempt to match the full distribution of liquid
wealth as we do in this paper. We also attempt to match the microdata on household
consumption behavior, much of which has come more recently. More closely aligned to the
methodology of our paper are <a 
href="#Xmckay2016role">McKay and Reis</a> (<a 
href="#Xmckay2016role">2016</a>), <a 
href="#Xmckay2021optimal">McKay and Reis</a> (<a 
href="#Xmckay2021optimal">2021</a>),
and <a 
href="#Xphan2024welfare">Phan</a> (<a 
href="#Xphan2024welfare">2024</a>) which look at the role of automatic stabilizers. By contrast, we
consider discretionary policies that have been invoked after a recession has begun.
Another related paper is <a 
href="#Xbayercoronavirus">Bayer, Born, Luetticke, and Müller</a> (<a 
href="#Xbayercoronavirus">2023</a>) who studies
ﬁscal policies implemented during the pandemic. They ﬁnd that targeted stimulus
through an increase in unemployment beneﬁts has a much larger multiplier than
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
an untargeted policy. In contrast, we ﬁnd that untargeted stimulus checks have
slightly higher multiplier eﬀects when compared with a targeted policy extending
eligibility for unemployment insurance. Our results derive from the fact that—as
in the data—even high liquid wealth consumers have relatively high MPCs in our
model.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  This paper is also closely related to the empirical literature that aims to estimate the
eﬀect of transitory income shocks and stimulus payments. We particularly focus on
<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), who use Norwegian administrative panel data with
sizable lottery wins to estimate the MPC out of transitory income in that year, as
well as the pattern of expenditure in the following years. We build a model that is
consistent with the patterns they identify. Examples of the literature that followed the
Great Recession in 2008 are <a 
href="#Xparker2013consumer">Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland</a> (<a 
href="#Xparker2013consumer">2013</a>) and
<a 
href="#Xbroda2014economic">Broda and Parker</a> (<a 
href="#Xbroda2014economic">2014</a>). These papers exploit the eﬀectively random timing of the
distribution of stimulus payments and identify a substantial consumption response.
The results indicate an MPC that is diﬃcult to reconcile with representative agent
models.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >  Thus, the paper relates to the literature presenting HA models that aim to be consistent
with the evidence from the micro-data. An example is <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>), who build
a model where agents save in both liquid and illiquid assets. The model yields a substantial
consumption response to a stimulus payment, since MPCs are high both for constrained,
low-wealth households and for households with substantial net worth that is mainly invested
in the illiquid asset (the “wealthy hand-to-mouth”). <a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, and
White</a> (<a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">2020</a>) present an HA model that is similar in many respects to the one we study.
Their focus is on predicting the consumption response to the 2020 U.S. CARES Act that
contains both an extension of unemployment beneﬁts and a stimulus check. However, neither
of these papers attempts to evaluate and rank the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent stimulus policies, as
we do.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >  <a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">2022</a>) discuss diﬀerent mechanisms used in HA models to obtain a
high MPC and the tension between that and ﬁtting the distribution of aggregate wealth. We
use one of the mechanisms they consider, <span 
class="ecti-1200">ex-ante </span>heterogeneity in discount factors, and build
a model that delivers both high average MPCs and a distribution of liquid wealth consistent
with the data. The model allows for splurge consumption and thus also delivers substantial
MPCs for high-liquid-wealth households. This helps the model match not only the initial
MPC, but also the propensity to spend out of a windfall for several periods after it is
obtained.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a

<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >  In our model, consumers do not adjust their labor supply in response to the stimulus
policies. Our assumption is broadly consistent with the empirical ﬁndings in <a

Noel, Sullivan, and Vavra</a> (<a

href="#Xchodorow2016limited">Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis</a> (<a 
href="#Xchodorow2016limited">2016</a>). However,
the literature is conﬂicted on this subject and <a

<a

href="#Xhagedorn2019unemployment">2019</a>) ﬁnd that extensions of unemployment
insurance aﬀect both search decisions and vacancy creation leading to a rise in unemployment.
<a 
href="#Xkekre2022unemp">Kekre</a> (<a 
href="#Xkekre2022unemp">2022</a>), on the other hand, evaluates the eﬀect of extending unemployment insurance in
the period from 2008 to 2014. He ﬁnds that this extension raised aggregate demand and
implied a lower unemployment rate than without the policy. However, he does not attempt
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
to compare the stimulus eﬀects of extending unemployment insurance with other
policies.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >  One criterion to rank policies is the extent to which spending is “multiplied,” and
our paper therefore relates to the vast literature discussing the size and timing of
any multiplier. Our focus is on policies implemented in the aftermath of the Great
Recession, a period when monetary policy was essentially ﬁxed at the zero lower
bound (ZLB). We therefore do not consider monetary policy responses to the policies
we evaluate in our primary analysis, and our work thus relates to papers such as
<a 
href="#Xchristiano2011government">Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo</a> (<a 
href="#Xchristiano2011government">2011</a>) and <a 
href="#Xeggertsson2011fiscal">Eggertsson</a> (<a 
href="#Xeggertsson2011fiscal">2011</a>), who argue
that ﬁscal multipliers are higher in such circumstances. <a 
href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">Hagedorn, Manovskii, and
Mitman</a> (<a 
href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">2019</a>) present an HA model with both incomplete markets and nominal
rigidities to evaluate the size of the ﬁscal multiplier and also ﬁnd that it is higher when
monetary policy is constrained. Unlike us, they focus on government spending instead of
transfers and are interested in diﬀerent options for ﬁnancing that spending. <a 
href="#Xbroer2023fiscalmultipliers">Broer,
Krusell, and Öberg</a> (<a 
href="#Xbroer2023fiscalmultipliers">2023</a>) also focus on ﬁscal multipliers for government spending and
show how they diﬀer in representative agent and HA models with diﬀerent sources
of nominal rigidities. <a 
href="#Xramey2018government">Ramey and Zubairy</a> (<a 
href="#Xramey2018government">2018</a>) investigate empirically whether
there is support for the model-based results that ﬁscal multipliers are higher in
certain states. While they ﬁnd evidence that multipliers are higher when there is slack
in the economy or the ZLB binds, the multipliers they ﬁnd are still below one in
most speciﬁcations. In any case, we condition on policies being implemented in a
recession—when, this literature argues, multipliers are higher—but it is not crucial for our
purposes whether the multipliers are greater than one or not. We are concerned with
relative multipliers, and the multiplier is only one of the two criteria we use to rank
policies.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >  The second criterion to rank policies is our measure of welfare. Thus, the paper relates to
the recent literature on welfare comparisons in HA models. Both <a 
href="#Xbhandari2021efficiency">Bhandari, Evans, Golosov,
and Sargent</a> (<a 
href="#Xbhandari2021efficiency">2021</a>) and <a 
href="#Xdavila2022welfare">Dávila and Schaab</a> (<a 
href="#Xdavila2022welfare">2022</a>) introduce ways of decomposing
welfare eﬀects. In the former case, these are aggregate eﬃciency, redistribution and
insurance, while the latter further decomposes the insurance part into intra- and
intertemporal components. These papers are related to ours, but we do not decompose the
welfare eﬀects. Regardless of decomposition, we want to (1) use a welfare measure as
an additional way of ranking policies and (2) introduce a measure that abstracts
from any incentive for a planner to redistribute in the steady state (or “normal”
times).

<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Consumers diﬀer by their level of education and, within education group, by subjective
discount factors (calibrated to match the within-group distribution of liquid wealth). We ﬁrst
describe each kind of consumer’s problem, given an income process with permanent and
transitory shocks calibrated to their type, as well as type-speciﬁc shocks to employment. The
next step describes the arrival of a recession and the policies we study as potential ﬁscal policy
responses. The last section discusses an extension incorporating aggregate demand eﬀects
that induce feedback from aggregate consumption to income and (via the marginal
propensity to consume) back to consumption, amplifying the eﬀect of a recession when it
occurs.

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >We model the arrival of a recession, and the government policy response to it, as an
unpredictable event—an MIT shock. We have four types of shocks: one representing a
recession and one for each of the three diﬀerent policy responses we consider. The policy
responses are usually modeled as in addition to the recession, but we also consider a
counterfactual in which the policy response occurs without a recession in order to understand
the welfare eﬀects of the policy.

  At the onset of a recession, several changes occur. First, the unemployment rate for each
education group doubles: Those who would have been unemployed in the absence of a
recession are still unemployed, and an additional number of consumers move from employment
to unemployment. Second, conditional on the recession continuing, the employment transition
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
matrix is adjusted so that unemployment remains at the new high level and the expected
length of time for an unemployment spell increases. In our baseline calibration, discussed in
detail in section <a 
href="#x1-180003.3.1">3.3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:calib --></a>, we set the expected length of an unemployment spell to one
and a half quarters in normal times, and this length increases to four quarters in a
recession. Third, the end of the recession occurs as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an
average length of recession of six quarters. Finally, at the end of a recession, the
employment transition matrix switches back to its original probabilities, and, as
a result, the unemployment rate trends down over time, back to its steady-state
level.

  The policies we consider in response to a recession are inspired by the Economic Stimulus
Act of 2008 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation
Act of 2010. The former included means tested stimulus checks in the form of tax rebates,
and the latter included both an extension of unemployment beneﬁts and a tax cut.
Based on these examples we therefore consider the following stimulus policies in our
framework:
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >  <a

<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a><span 
class="ecbx-1200">1. Stimulus check.</span></span>
  In this policy response, the government sends money to every consumer that directly
increases the household’s market resources. The checks are means-tested depending on
permanent income. A check for $1,200 is sent to every household with permanent income less
than $100,000, and this amount is then linearly reduced to zero for households with a
permanent income greater than $150,000. Similar policies were implemented in the U.S. in
2001, 2008, and during the pandemic.

 id="x1-10000"></a><span 
class="ecbx-1200">2. Extended unemployment beneﬁts.</span></span>
  In this policy response, unemployment beneﬁts are extended from two quarters to four
quarters. That is, those who become unemployed at the start of the recession, or who were
already unemployed, will receive unemployment beneﬁts for up to four quarters (including
quarters leading up to the recession). Those who become unemployed one quarter into the
recession will receive up to three quarters of unemployment beneﬁts. These extended
unemployment beneﬁts will occur regardless of whether the recession ends, and
no further extensions are granted if the recession continues. This policy reﬂects
temporary changes made to unemployment beneﬁts in the U.S. following the great
recession.

  Some work in the HA macro literature has shown that if taxes are raised immediately to
oﬀset any ﬁscal stimulus, results can be very diﬀerent than they would be if, as occurs in
reality, recessionary policies are debt ﬁnanced. However, typical ﬁscal rules assume that any
increase in debt gets ﬁnanced over a long interval. Accordingly, almost all of the eﬀects of any
particular ﬁscal rule will be similar for each of our policies so long as the great
majority of the debt is repaid after the short recessionary period that is our main
focus.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >  To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we do not model the debt repayment. Any of a
variety of ﬁscal rules could be imposed for the period following our short period of interest,
but we did not want to choose any particular ﬁscal rule in order to avoid making a choice that
has little consequence for our key question. Advocates of alternative ﬁscal rules likely
already have intuitions about how such rules’ economic consequences diﬀer, but those
consequences—under our partial equilibrium analysis—will be similar for all three policies we
consider. Alternative choices of ﬁscal rules will therefore not aﬀect the ranking of policies that
is our principal concern.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a

<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Our baseline model is a partial equilibrium model that does not include any feedback from
aggregate consumption to income. In an extension to the model, we add aggregate demand
eﬀects during the recession. The motivation for this speciﬁcation comes from the idea that
spending in an economy with substantial slack and in which the central bank is unable to
prevent a recession will result in higher utilization rates and greater output. By
contrast, government spending in an economy running at potential with an active
monetary policy will not succeed in increasing output. The recent inﬂation experience
of the U.S. provides some evidence that output responds highly non-linearly to

the policies in a model that is consistent with the best available micro-evidence of

households into educational groups in the United States. We use data on the distribution of
liquid wealth from the 2004 wave of the SCF. We restrict our attention to households where
the head is of working age, which we deﬁne to be in the range from 25 to 62. The SCF-variable
“normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent income, and, to exclude
outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5 percent of the distribution of
this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for households in our sample is thus
$16,708.

market, checking, savings, and call accounts; directly held mutual funds; and stocks and

that the SCF does not contain information on cash holdings, so these are imputed with the
procedure described in Appendix B.1 of <a

without obtaining a bachelor’s degree; and the third group, “College,” consists of

household, and we typically think of individual characteristics as applying to that

<!--l. 405--><p class="noindent" >Before we move on to compare diﬀerent consumption stimulus policies in the calibrated model,
we also report implications of the model for some non-targeted moments. Panel A of
table <a 
href="#x1-20001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:nonTargetedMoments --></a> shows the wealth distribution across the three education groups in the data
and in the model. The model matches these shares quite closely, which may not be
surprising given that we calibrate the size of each group and we manage to ﬁt the wealth
distribution within each group separately. The panel also reports the average marginal
propensity to consume for the diﬀerent groups. To be comparable to numbers reported
in <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), these are calculated as the average MPC
in the year of a lottery win. Lottery wins occur in a random quarter of the year
that diﬀers across individuals. The MPC for an individual depends on the spending
pattern after the win, and these are averaged across individuals within each education
group.
<!--l. 414--><p class="indent" >  Panel B of table <a 
href="#x1-20001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:nonTargetedMoments --></a> shows similar numbers to Panel A, sorted by quartiles of the liquid
wealth distribution instead of education groups. Our model yields a slightly more concentrated
liquid wealth distribution than in the data. However, it does produce a fairly high MPC even
for households in the highest quartile of the liquid wealth distribution. This is consistent with
the results found in the Norwegian data by <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), but also with
recent results in <a 
href="#Xgraham2024mental">Graham and McDowall</a> (<a 
href="#Xgraham2024mental">2024</a>). In an administrative dataset from a large US
ﬁnancial institution, they ﬁnd that the spending response to an income receipt is large
across the distribution of liquid asset holdings. In our model, we obtain this result
due to the inclusion of the splurge factor. As shown in Appendix <a 
href="#x1-32000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:Model_without_splurge --></a>, the model is
not able to generate a high MPC for the highest wealth quartile without splurge
consumption.

<!--l. 482--><p class="indent" >  Finally, we consider the implications of our model for two diﬀerent patterns of
spending over time. The ﬁrst pattern is the dynamics of spending after a lottery win
from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a>. This pattern was used in the estimation of the
splurge factor in section <a 
href="#x1-150003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a>, but was not targeted when estimating the discount
factor distributions for each education group in section <a 
href="#x1-190003.3.2">3.3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:estimBetas --></a>. Figure <a 
href="#x1-20002r1">2a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:USaggmpclotterywin --></a> shows that
the model that is estimated taking the value of the splurge as given, results in a
distribution of spending over time that is very similar to the one found in the Norwegian
data.
<!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >  The second pattern concerns the dynamics of income and spending for households that
become unemployed and remain unemployed long enough for unemployment beneﬁts to
expire. Figure <a 
href="#x1-20003r2">2b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:expiryUI --></a> shows the pattern of income and spending for such households. <a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">Ganong
and Noel</a> (<a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">2019</a>) report the empirical result that nondurable spending drops by 12
percent the month when beneﬁts expire. Our quarterly model is broadly consistent
with this, and the drop in spending the quarter after the expiry of UI beneﬁts is 18
percent.

an extension of unemployment beneﬁts, and a payroll tax cut. Each policy is implemented at
the start of a recession, and we compare results both with and without aggregate demand
eﬀects being active during the recession. First, we present impulse responses of aggregate
income and consumption after the implementation of each policy. Then we compare the
policies in terms of their cumulative multipliers and in terms of their eﬀect on a welfare
measure that we introduce. Finally, based on these comparisons, we can rank the three
policies.

<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-23001r1">3a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessioncheckrelrecession --></a> shows the impulse response of income and consumption when stimulus checks are
issued in the ﬁrst quarter of a recession. In the model without a multiplier, the stimulus checks
account for 5 percent of the ﬁrst quarter’s income. In the following quarters, there are no
further stimulus payments, and income remains the same as it would have been without the
stimulus check policy. Consumption is about 2.5 percent higher in the ﬁrst quarter, which
includes the splurge response to the stimulus check. Consumption then drops to less than 1
percent above the counterfactual, and the remainder of the stimulus check money is then spent
over the next few years. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income in
the ﬁrst quarter is 6 percent higher than the counterfactual, as the extra spending
feeds into higher incomes. Consumption in this model jumps to a higher level than
without aggregate demand eﬀects and comes down more slowly as the feedback eﬀects
from consumption to income dampen the speed with which income—and hence the
splurge—return to zero. After a couple of years, when the recession is most likely over and
aggregate demand eﬀects are no longer in place, income is close to where it would
be without the stimulus check policy, although consumption remains somewhat
elevated.

<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >The impulse responses in ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-23002r2">3b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessionuirelrecession --></a> show the response to a policy that extends unemployment
beneﬁts from 6 months to 12 months for a period of a year. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, the path for income now depends on the number of consumers who receive
the extended unemployment beneﬁts. These consumers are those who have been
unemployed for between 6 and 12 months. In the ﬁrst quarter of the recession, the newly
unemployed receive unemployment beneﬁts regardless of whether they are extended or not.
Therefore, it is in the second and third quarters, when the eﬀects of the recession on
long-term unemployment start to materialize, that the extended UI payments ramp up,
amounting to an aggregate increase in quarterly income by 0.7 percent. By the ﬁfth
quarter, the policy is no longer in eﬀect, and income from extended unemployment
goes to zero. Consumption in the ﬁrst quarter jumps by more than income (by 0.3
percent), prompted by both the increase in expected income and the reduced need for
precautionary saving given the extended insurance. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, consumption is only a little above the counterfactual by the time
the policy is over. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, there is an extra
boost to income of about the same size in the ﬁrst and second quarters. As this
extra aggregate demand induced income goes to employed consumers, more of it is
saved, and consumption remains elevated several quarters beyond the end of the
policy.

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁnal impulse response graph, ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-23003r3">3c<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessiontaxcutrelrecession --></a>, shows the impulse response for a payroll tax cut
that persists for two years (eight quarters). In the model without aggregate demand eﬀects,
income rises by close to 2 percent as the take-home pay for employed consumers goes up. After
the two-year period, income drops back to where it would have been without the payroll
tax cut. Consumption jumps close to 1 percent in response to the tax cut. Over
the period in which the tax cut is in eﬀect, consumption rises somewhat as the
stock of precautionary savings goes up. Following the drop in income, consumption
drops sharply because of the splurge and then decreases over time as consumers
spend out the savings they built up over the period the tax cut was in eﬀect. In the
model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income rises by about 2.3 percent above the
counterfactual and then declines steadily as the probability that the recession remains
active—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀects in place—goes down over time.
Following the end of the policy, the savings stock in the model with aggregate demand
eﬀects is high, and consumption remains signiﬁcantly elevated through the period
shown.

href="#x1-26003r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> shows the
10y-horizon multiplier for each policy. The stimulus check, which is paid out in quarter one,
exhibits the largest multiplier on impact. About 50 percent of the total policy expenditure is
immediately spent by consumers. After two years, and because of the aggregate demand
eﬀects, consumption has increased cumulatively by more than the cost of the stimulus check.
Over time, the policy reaches a total multiplier of 1.199. Without AD eﬀects the
policy only generates a multiplier of 0.854. The last two rows in table <a 
href="#x1-26003r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> show the
expected share of the policy expenditures and stimulated consumption that occurs
during a recession. For the stimulus check all of the policy expenditures occur in the
ﬁrst quarter and thus with certainty during the recession. However, since induced
consumption also takes place during later periods at which time the recession may have
already ended, the share of stimulated consumption during the recession is lower at
75%.
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >  Since spending for the UI policy is spread out over four quarters (and peaks in quarters two
to three), the multiplier in the ﬁrst quarter is considerably lower than in the case of the
stimulus check. However, the UI extension policy is targeted in the sense that it provides
additional income to only those consumers, who, because of unemployment, have large MPCs.
Also, over the medium-term UI extension expenditures are more likely to induce consumption
spending during the recession compared to the check stimulus, see the last row
in table <a 
href="#x1-26003r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a>. This is because UI extension expenditures aﬀect agents who spent the
additional income relatively quickly once it reaches them. Therefore, the cumulative
mulitiplier of the UI extension exceeds that of the stimulus check after about one
year.

<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut has the lowest multiplier irrespective of the considered horizon. A
multiplier of close to 1 is reached only after 10 years with AD eﬀects. These relatively small
numbers reﬂect that policy spending lasts for a long time and is thus more likely to occur after
the recession has ended. Moreover, only employed consumers, often with relatively low MPCs,
beneﬁt directly from the payroll tax cut. Therefore, the policy is poorly targeted if the goal is
to provide short-term stimulus.
<!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-26003r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> contains an additional (middle) row with results for an economy where we only
consider a “ﬁrst-round” aggregate demand eﬀect. To understand these values note that the
policies initially increase the income of consumers directly, which leads to a boost in
consumption. As a consequence, this boost triggers an aggregate demand eﬀect
which increases the income of everyone and in turn leads to an additional boost to
consumption. We refer to the sum of this initial and the indirect boost to consumption as
the ﬁrst-round AD eﬀect. However, the AD eﬀect continues as the indirect boost
to consumption triggers another round of income increases which further boost
consumption and so on. One might argue that these higher-order rounds of the AD
eﬀect are not likely to be anticipated by consumers. Since higher-order consumption
boosts only materialize if consumers anticipate them and act accordingly, the overall
increase in consumption might turn out to be smaller than suggested by the full AD
eﬀect. As shown in the middle row of the table, the multipliers are smaller when
excluding higher-order rounds. Nevertheless, the ranking of the policies remains
unchanged.

<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we look at the welfare implications of each stimulus policy. To do so, we need a
way to aggregate welfare in our model with individual utility functions. In our model, some
households consume much less than other households, and a social planner with equal weights
on each household could signiﬁcantly increase welfare through redistribution across households
even in normal times. We are interested in the beneﬁt of carrying out ﬁscal policies in a
recession, so we do not want our results to reﬂect the beneﬁts of redistribution inherent in our
model in normal times.
<!--l. 173--><p class="indent" >  Our welfare measure weights the felicity of a household at time <span

marginal utility of the same household in a counterfactual simulation in which neither the

rate.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-22" id="enmark-22"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">22</span></a></sup> This weighting scheme means that in normal times the marginal beneﬁt or cost to a
social planner of moving a dollar of consumption from one household at one time period to
another household at the same or a diﬀerent time period is zero. Hence, in normal times,
any re-distributive policy has zero marginal beneﬁt. However, in a recession when
the average marginal utility is higher than in normal times, there can be welfare
beneﬁts to government borrowing to allow households to consume more during the

Furthermore, our welfare measure distinguishes between households that would have
suﬀered unemployment in normal times and households that are made unemployed as
a result of the recession—–giving the later a higher weight in the social welfare

<!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-27002r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare6 --></a> shows the welfare measure for each policy as deﬁned by equation (<a 
href="#x1-27001r10">10<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare_def6 --></a>). The top row
of the table shows the welfare measure for implementing each policy in normal times. For
marginal policies, this is equal to one by deﬁnition. Indeed, the value for both the stimulus
check and the tax cut policy is very close to one. However, the welfare measure for the
extended unemployment policy in normal times is noticeably less than one. This is because,
although this policy is smaller in absolute size than the other policies, its consumption eﬀects
are concentrated on a small number of households that remain unemployed long enough
to receive the extended beneﬁts. For these households, the eﬀect on consumption
is large enough such that the non linearity of the consumption function leads to
smaller welfare beneﬁt than the marginal utility of consumption would otherwise
imply.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >  The second row of table <a 
href="#x1-27002r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare6 --></a> shows the welfare beneﬁt of each policy in a recession without
any aggregate demand eﬀects. Again, the stimulus check and tax cut policies have measures
that are close to one—pulling forward consumption has little welfare beneﬁt for the average
household because the average marginal utility of consumption is only a little higher
than in normal times. By contrast, the policy sees beneﬁts of 1.8 dollars for every
dollar spent on extended UI beneﬁts during a recession. This is because many of
the households who are unemployed for many quarters in the recession would have
never been unemployed, or quickly reemployed, in normal times and hence their
marginal utility of consumption is much higher in the recession than in normal
times.
<!--l. 222--><p class="indent" >  The third row of the table shows the welfare measure for each policy in a recession in the
version of the model with aggregate demand eﬀects during the recession. The payroll tax cut
now has a noticeable beneﬁt, as some of the tax cut gets spent during the recession,
resulting in higher incomes for all consumers. However, the tax cut is received over a
period of two years, and much of the relief may be after the recession—and hence the
aggregate demand eﬀect—is over. Furthermore, because the payroll tax cut goes only to
employed consumers who have relatively lower MPCs, the spending out of this stimulus
will be further delayed, possibly beyond the period of the recession. By contrast,
the stimulus check is received in the ﬁrst period of the recession and goes to both
employed and unemployed consumers. The earlier arrival and higher MPCs of the
stimulus check recipients mean more of the stimulus is spent during the recession,
leading to greater aggregate demand eﬀects, higher income, and higher welfare. The
extended UI arrives, on average, slightly later than the stimulus check. However,
the recipients, who have been unemployed for at least six months, spend the extra
beneﬁts relatively quickly, resulting in signiﬁcant aggregate demand eﬀects during
the recession. In contrast to the payroll tax cut, extended UI has the beneﬁt of
automatically reducing if the recession ends early, making fewer consumers eligible for the
beneﬁt.

<!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >The results presented in sections <a 
href="#x1-260004.2">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:multipliers --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-270004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a> indicate that the extension of unemployment
beneﬁts is the clear “bang for the buck” winner. The extended UI payments are well targeted
to consumers with high MPCs and high marginal utility, giving rise to large multipliers and
welfare improvements. The stimulus checks come in slightly higher when measured by their
short-term multiplier eﬀect but are a distant second when measured by their welfare eﬀects.
The stimulus checks have large initial multipliers because the money gets to consumers at the
beginning of the recession and therefore induce aggregate demand eﬀects more quickly.
However, the checks are not well targeted to high-MPC consumers, so even though
the funds arrive early in the recession, they are spent out more slowly than the
extended unemployment beneﬁts.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-26" id="enmark-26"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">26</span></a></sup> Furthermore, the average recipient of a stimulus
check has a much lower marginal utility than consumers receiving unemployment
beneﬁts, so the welfare beneﬁts of this policy are substantially muted relative to UI
extensions.
<!--l. 242--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut policy does poorly by both measures: It has a low overall
multiplier and negligible welfare beneﬁts. The reasons are that the funds are slow
to arrive, so the subsequent spending often occurs after the end of the recession,
and that the payments are particularly badly targeted—they go only to employed
consumers.
<!--l. 245--><p class="indent" >  While it is clear from the analysis that the extended unemployment beneﬁts should be the
ﬁrst tool to use, a disadvantage of them is that they are limited in their size. If a larger ﬁscal
stimulus is deemed appropriate, then stimulus checks provide an alternative option that will
stimulate spending during the recession even if the welfare beneﬁts are substantially lower
than the UI extension.

 id="x1-290004.5"></a>Results in a model without the splurge</h4>
<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" >We introduce the splurge in our model with the aim of matching empirical evidence on the
dynamics of spending in response to transitory income shocks. The splurge acts as a stand-in
for competing theories for why agents may spend more out of those shocks than suggested by
a simple model in which forward-looking agents solely maximize utility. However,
it is natural to consider to what extent the splurge is in fact necessary to match
the empirical patterns and the implications for our results ranking the diﬀerent
policies. To assess this we reestimate the model without the splurge and recompute all
our results regarding the relative eﬀectiveness of the policies in this version of the
model.
<!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >  The details of this exercise are in Appendix <a 
href="#x1-32000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:Model_without_splurge --></a>. There we discuss how the estimation of the
Norwegian model in section <a 
href="#x1-150003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a> is aﬀected if we do not include splurge consumption, and the
estimation of the discount factor distributions for each education group in the US economy
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
without taking the splurge as given. The general result is that the we can match the liquid
wealth distributions that we target also in models that do not include a splurge. The models
do so by estimating wider distributions of discount factors than we found in section <a 
href="#x1-150003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a>
and <a 
href="#x1-190003.3.2">3.3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:estimBetas --></a>.
<!--l. 263--><p class="indent" >  Without the splurge the models do struggle to exactly match the dynamics of spending after
a temporary income shock, however. In particular, for the estimation of the Norwegian model,
we can compare the model’s implications for MPCs for diﬀerent wealth quartiles to empirical
estimates. Without the splurge, the model leads to an MPC for the top wealth quartile that is
far lower than in the data. In the US model this MPC is also quite low compared to the model
with splurge consumption, but for the US we do not have an empirical estimate to compare
to.
<!--l. 269--><p class="indent" >  To evaluate the impact of splurge consumption on our ranking of the policies, we simulate
the three ﬁscal policies in the reestimated model without the splurge. There are
only minor shifts in the multipliers of the policies, but the lower average MPCs
reduces multipliers for the check and tax cut policy relative to the model with the
splurge. In contrast, the UI extension becomes slighlty more eﬀective in stimulating
consumption as the wider distribution of discount factors implies a larger share of the
population that hits the borrowing constraint upon expiry of UI beneﬁts. Hence,
the extension of UI beneﬁts aﬀects agents more strongly in the model without the
splurge.
<!--l. 274--><p class="indent" >  More importantly for the main conclusion of our paper, table <a 
href="#x1-29001r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:welfare6_SplurgeComp --></a> compares the welfare
implications of the policies in the two models. Generally, the welfare metric varies only
marginally across the models. When aggregate demand eﬀects are active, we see slightly larger
diﬀerences in the welfare evaluation, with the check policy losing ground against the
UI extension. This is because the welfare impact of the check in the model with
the splurge is contingent on the checks being spent quickly due to a high average
MPC and thus generating strong aggregate demand eﬀects while the recession is
still ongoing. In the absence of the splurge only liquidity-constrained agents spend
the check money quickly, such that recession-induced aggregate demand eﬀects are
smaller.

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The main results of this paper are presented in a partial equilibrium setup with
aggregate demand eﬀects that do not arise from general equilibrium eﬀects. We
think there are many advantages to studying the welfare and multiplier eﬀects in
this setting without embedding the model in general equilibrium. First, general
equilibrium models often struggle to adequately capture the feedback mechanisms between
consumption and income, particularly the asymmetric nature of these relationships
during recessionary versus expansionary periods. Additionally, a complete general
equilibrium treatment would necessitate the analysis of numerous complex channels
including investment dynamics, ﬁrm ownership structures and dividend distribution
policies, inventory management, and international trade ﬂows—elements that, while
important in their own right, would potentially obscure the core mechanisms we aim to
investigate.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Despite the advantages of our partial equilibrium approach, here we complement
our analysis with a general equilibrium HANK and SAM model, as standard as
possible, that is able to capture supply-side eﬀects that are absent from the partial
equilibrium model. In particular, ﬁscal policies can generate labor market responses that
our partial equilibrium analysis does not address. These supply-side channels can
aﬀect both the welfare implications and the ﬁscal multipliers of diﬀerent policy
interventions.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  We embed the consumption choices of our households—–with heterogeneity over
education type and discount factors—–in a New Keynesian model with search and
matching. Aside from the consumption block of the model, the framework closely
follows <a 
href="#XDu2024">Du</a> (<a 
href="#XDu2024">2024</a>), with complete details provided in appendix <a 
href="#x1-36000B">B<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:hank_appendix --></a>.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#ennote-27" id="enmark-27"><span 
class="ecrm-1095">27</span></a></sup> The general
equilibrium structure generates ﬁscal multipliers through an intertemporal Keynesian cross
mechanism, which becomes particularly pronounced when monetary policy is passive.
Moreover, the search and matching framework allows the employment rate to respond to
policy interventions, allowing us to capture both demand and supply eﬀects of ﬁscal
policies.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  Our approach in this section relies on linearizing the macro dynamics of the model and
employs the Sequence Space Jacobian methods developed by <a 
href="#XAuclert2021">Auclert, Bardóczy,
Rognlie, and Straub</a> (<a 
href="#XAuclert2021">2021</a>). This linearization imposes certain constraints on our
analysis. Notably, we cannot evaluate the eﬀects of diﬀerent policies starting from a
deep recessionary state, as we do in our main results. This limitation prevents us
from conducting welfare comparisons between recessionary periods and the steady
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
state. Additionally, the Keynesian cross mechanism embedded in the model exhibits
uniform behavior regardless of the degree of economic slack—–a feature that stands
in contrast to the state-dependent multipliers we apply in our partial equilibrium
analysis.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a

<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-30002r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:HANK_multipliers --></a> shows the consumption multipliers over diﬀerent horizons under a ﬁxed real rate
rule, alongside those in our baseline partial equilibrium model. The multipliers are bigger in
the HANK and SAM model. Nevertheless, in both models, the relative ranking of the
consumption multipliers over time horizons are similar, with the eﬀect of the tax cut
substantially smaller than the stimulus check or UI extension policies, despite the inclusion of
supply-side eﬀects in this HANK model. However, towards the end of the period shown the
tax cut consumption multiplier is near that of the stimulus check. This is because the
aggregate demand eﬀects in our partial equilibrium model do not continue beyond the
recession, dampening the beneﬁts of the tax cut policy—in which much of the extra spending
occurs after the recession is over—relative to the stimulus check and extended UI
policies.

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >For many years leading up to the Great Recession, a widely held view among macroeconomists
was that countercyclical policy should be left to central banks, because ﬁscal policy responses
were unpredictable in their timing, their content, and their eﬀects. Nevertheless, even during
this period, ﬁscal policy responses to recessions were repeatedly tried, perhaps because the
macroeconomists’ advice to policymakers, “don’t just do something; stand there”—is not
politically tenable.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic modeling has ﬁnally advanced to the point
where we can make reasonably credible assessments of the eﬀects of alternative policies of the
kinds that have been tried. The key developments have been both the advent of national
registry datasets that can measure crucial microeconomic phenomena and the creation of tools
of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic modeling that can match those micro facts and glean
their macroeconomic implications.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  We examine three ﬁscal policy experiments that have actually been implemented in the
past: an extension of UI beneﬁts, a stimulus check, and a tax cut on labor income. Our model
suggests that the extension of UI beneﬁts is a clear “bang for the buck” winner. While the
stimulus check arrives faster and generates multiplier eﬀects more quickly, it is less well
targeted to high-MPC households than an extension of UI beneﬁts. By contrast, the welfare
gains of extended UI beneﬁts are signiﬁcantly greater than those of a stimulus check. The chief
drawback of the UI extension is that its size is limited by the fact that a relatively small share
of the population is aﬀected by it. In contrast, stimulus checks are easily scalable while
exhibiting only slightly less recession-period stimulus (in a typical recession). However,
since some of the stimulus checks ﬂow to well-oﬀ consumers, such checks do worse
than UI extensions when we evaluate welfare consequences. Finally, the payroll tax
cut is the least eﬀective in terms of both the multiplier and welfare eﬀect, since it
targets only employed consumers and, for a typical recession, more of its payouts
are likely to occur after the recessionary period (when multipliers may exist) has
ended.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  The tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other
policies. For example, in the COVID-driven recession, not only was the duration of UI beneﬁts
extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by substantial payments to all UI
recipients. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but the framework
could accommodate such an analysis.

<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >  While the splurge helps in matching the empirical evidence on the IMPC, the model

many agents are at the borrowing constraint and thus sensitive to transitory income
shocks.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >  However, the model is not quite able to match the diﬀerence in spending between the initial
year of the lottery win and the year after. The model without the splurge exhibits a higher
spending propensity in the year after the shock occurs as borrowing-constrained
agents spend the additional income quicker. The model without the splurge also
provides a worse ﬁt of the distribution of liquid wealth. Relative to the baseline
model, and to the data, the model without a splurge generates a more unequal wealth
distribution.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >  The reason for these two eﬀects, becomes apparent when considering the cross-sectional
implications of the models with and without the splurge across diﬀerent wealth quartiles.
While the model with the splurge can account for the empirically-observed initial MPCs
among the wealthiest, the model without the splurge exhibits much lower MPCs among that
group, see Table <a 
href="#x1-33004r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Comparison_Splurge_Table --></a>. The wealthiest group will thus be very patient and have low MPCs, which

href="#x1-20004r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:untargetedMoments --></a> with results from the model

to a slightly too low MPC in the year of a lottery win and a slightly higher MPC in the year
after.
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >  The drop in spending when unemployment beneﬁts expire is virtually the same in the
model without splurge consumption (17 percent versus 18 percent in the baseline).
While the consumption dynamics across the models with and without a splurge
are fairly similar, the underlying drivers of the consumption drop upon expiry of
unemployment beneﬁts are diﬀerent. In the model with the splurge, the drop in income
translates directly into lower consumption via the splurge itself. In the model without
the splurge it is the sharp rise in agents hitting the borrowing constraint which
accounts for the consumption drop after UI beneﬁts expire. This is shown in the
solid and dashed red lines in Figure <a 
href="#x1-34004r2">9b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:expiryUI_wSplZero --></a>, and is due to the wider distribution of
discount factors that is needed to match the wealth distributions in the model without
the splurge. This leads to a greater number of agents being close the borrowing
constraint.

<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >In this section we simulate the three ﬁscal policies from the main text in the estimated model
without the splurge. The shape of the impulse response functions only marginally change
relative to the model with the splurge. Hence, we focus on the quantitative changes as
summarized by the cumulative multipliers in Figure <a 
href="#x1-35001r11">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cumulativemultipliers_SplurgeComp --></a>. The ﬁgure shows the multipliers when
AD eﬀects are switched on for the model with and without the splurge. Table <a 
href="#x1-35002r10">10<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier_SplurgeComp --></a> shows the
10y-horizon multiplier across the two models.
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >  The absence of the splurge entails a calibration with a lower average MPC in the
population. Hence, the check and tax cut exhibit lower multipliers when there is no splurge.
For the UI extension we observe the opposite pattern, as the multiplier is larger in the model
without the splurge. This due to the consumption dynamics around the expiry of
UI beneﬁts described in the previous section. In the model without the splurge
more agents hit the borrowing constraint upon the expiry of beneﬁts. Providing
those agents with an extension of UI beneﬁts thus turns out to be slightly more
powerful.
<!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >  The policy ranking in terms of the multiplier shifts slighlty. In the model with the splurge,
the check policy delivers multiplier eﬀects much more rapidly than the UI extension. In the
model without splurge consumption, the UI extension appears superior to the check, both at
shorter and longer horizons. Both models agree on the tax cut being the least eﬀective
policy.
