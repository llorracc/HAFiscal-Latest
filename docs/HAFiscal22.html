  deﬁned and do not depend on aggregate demand eﬀects. For the payroll tax cut, we deﬁne the
  payments as the diﬀerence between the take-home pay with and without the tax cut, but ignoring any
  aggregate demand eﬀects. Aggregate demand eﬀects would increase the value of the tax cut because
  incomes would rise, but, in fact, the eﬀects increase rather than decrease the tax receipts of the
  government.</span></p></div>
