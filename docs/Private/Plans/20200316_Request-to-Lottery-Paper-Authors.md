Defining $\Delta_{0} X[i]$ as the NOK by which expenditures $X$ are higher in the year of the lottery win for person $i$ as a result of winning the lottery, and $\chi^{\prime}[i] = \Delta_{0} X[i]/L[i]$, and ranking people by their percentiles in the distribution of liquid assets and the distribution of lottery sizes, we'd like numbers like those in your original Table 9:

| \ | $A_{25}$ | $A_{50}$ | $A_{75}$ | $A_{100}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $L_{25}$ | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{25,25}$  | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{50,25}$ | ... |  ... |
| $L_{50}$ | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{25,50}$  | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{50,50}$ | ... |  ... | 
| $L_{75}$ | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{25,75}$  | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{50,50}$ | ... |  ... | 
| $L_{100}$ | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{25,100}$  | $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{50,50}$ | ... |  ... | 

where, for example, $\bar{\chi}^{\prime}_{25,25}$ is the average value of $\chi^{\prime}[i]$ for persons who were in the lowest category quartile of both liquid assets and lottery winnings, and then for exactly the same people (in the same bins), their marginal propensity to continue expending $\bar{\chi}^{\prime} = \frac{\Delta_{t} X[i]}{L[i]}$ for years $t=1,2$ (and further years if zero cost for you).

Then, using lower case $a$ and $\ell$ to signify the corresponding capital letter divided by $P$, we'd like the population resorted to put them into percentile bins for $a$ and $\ell$, and the corresponding tables of those figures.

(Note that the individual $\chi^{\prime}[i]$ values do not need to be recomputed because $\Delta_{t} x/\ell = $(\Delta_{t} X/P)/(L/P)$.
