**Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies** – _Summary and Key Insights_
==============================================================================================

Overview
--------

This document is an economic analysis of three fiscal **stimulus policies** aimed at boosting consumer spending during recessions. The authors employ a **heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic model** calibrated with real-world data on how households spend after receiving extra income​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

. In particular, the model matches measured spending dynamics over four years following an income shock (from Fagereng _et al._, 2021), capturing the concept of an **intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (IMPC)** – essentially how quickly different households spend additional income​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

. Using this microdata-driven framework, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of **three policy interventions** that have been used in recent downturns​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

: extending unemployment insurance benefits, distributing one-time stimulus checks, and implementing a temporary payroll tax cut. The goal is to determine which policy delivers the greatest _“bang for the buck”_ in terms of improving household welfare and stimulating spending in a recessionary period​

.

Key Findings
------------

The analysis finds **significant differences** in how each policy impacts consumer spending and welfare during a recession. Below are the key takeaways for each policy option:

*   **Unemployment Insurance (UI) Extensions:** _Extending the duration of jobless benefits_ provides the highest return in terms of boosting welfare and consumption. It is the clear “bang for the buck” winner when effectiveness is measured in utility (welfare) terms​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . By targeting unemployed individuals who have high marginal propensity to consume (MPC), this policy channels funds to households likely to spend them quickly, yielding strong stimulus. Quantitatively, in a recession scenario with aggregate-demand effects, the model’s _welfare metric_ for an extended UI policy is roughly **2.1**, compared to about **1.3** for stimulus checks (and ~1.1 for a tax cut) – indicating nearly double the welfare impact per dollar spent​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . The only limitation is scale: because only a subset of the population (job seekers) benefit, the total dollars injected are constrained by the number of unemployed​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    .
    
*   **One-Time Stimulus Checks:** _Direct payments to households_ rank second in effectiveness. Stimulus checks have two clear advantages: **speed** and **breadth**. They arrive faster than other measures and can be delivered to virtually everyone, making them easily scalable to any desired size​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . This immediate, wide-reaching infusion helps jump-start consumption early in a downturn​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . However, because the payments go out to all income levels, a portion of the money flows to relatively well-off consumers who are less likely to spend it immediately (low MPC households)​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    ​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . As a result, stimulus checks are slightly less cost-effective in boosting welfare compared to UI extensions. In the model, they generate substantial consumption in the short run, but their **welfare gains** are somewhat lower than the UI policy since not all the funds reach those in acute need​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    .
    
*   **Temporary Payroll Tax Cut:** _Cutting the payroll (wage) tax for a limited period_ is found to be the **least effective** of the three policies. This tax relief primarily benefits people who remain employed during the recession, a group that on average is less liquidity-constrained and thus less inclined to immediately spend the extra take-home pay​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . Moreover, much of the financial benefit from a tax cut accrues over time (with each paycheck) and may even continue after the recession ends, missing the window when stimulating spending is most critical​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . In the model’s results, a two-year payroll tax rate cut produces negligible consumption stimulus in the absence of demand-side multipliers​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . Even with broader economic effects considered, it delivers only a modest boost (a welfare impact around 1.1, barely above doing nothing)​
    
    file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv
    
    . Thus, compared to the other options, payroll tax cuts give the smallest “bang for the buck” in recession-fighting terms.
    

Conclusion
----------

Overall, the study concludes that **targeted transfers to high-MPC households yield the greatest welfare and spending impact in recessions**. Extending unemployment benefits emerges as the most cost-effective policy for alleviating economic distress and stimulating demand​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

. Stimulus checks can mobilize spending quickly and at scale, but because they are less targeted, their dollars deliver slightly less punch per dollar – though they remain a valuable tool, especially when rapid, widespread relief is needed. Payroll tax cuts, by contrast, are an inefficient stimulus in a downturn, as they funnel resources to those least likely to spend them immediately and largely take effect outside the critical recession period​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

.

Notably, this paper demonstrates how modern heterogeneous-agent models, grounded in detailed household data, can credibly assess such policy trade-offs​

file-vwp9nww9pkel2vvykh2viv

. The ranking of policies (UI extension first, stimulus checks second, tax cuts last) holds robust across different modeling assumptions in the study. In practical terms, the findings support the idea that **bolstering unemployment insurance** during recessions offers the best “bang for the buck” in terms of both improving consumer welfare and generating consumption, whereas broad but shallow measures like across-the-board tax cuts are far less effective. These insights can help inform policymakers designing fiscal stimulus packages for future economic downturns.

    . The presence of borrowing-constrained “hand-to-mouth” consumers means that **who pays for and who receives the stimulus matters for the multiplier**. In simulations, transfers directed to poorer, high-MPC agents yield much larger output multipliers than uniform or rich-targeted transfers. This result provided early theoretical insight into why **fiscal stimulus targeted at cash-strapped households can significantly boost consumption** in heterogeneous-agent settings.

    . This suggests that high-income households have low MPCs (they tend to save tax windfalls), while lower-income households are more likely to spend extra income, consistent with heterogeneous MPCs.

    . Moreover, the model shows that the **aggregate consumption response to a stimulus depends on how the payment is distributed across households** – for example, giving more to high-MPC (low-wealth or unemployed) households yields a larger total boost in consumption​

    , but there is **substantial unobserved heterogeneity** in MPCs across households. Interestingly, while some demographics and financial variables (e.g. income, wealth, etc.) correlate with MPC one-by-one, those correlations **largely disappear when considered jointly** – traditional observables can explain **only about 25% of the variation in MPCs**​

    . This implies the remaining differences are due to latent factors (e.g. preferences, expectations, or other unmeasured constraints). In sum, the paper’s key contribution is showing that **MPC heterogeneity is pervasive and not easily captured by basic household observables**, which has implications for targeting fiscal stimulus: identifying high-MPC groups may be more complex than just using income or age cutoffs.

    . They also find the composition of spending in 2020 skews more towards food and debt payments (and less towards durable goods) compared to earlier stimulus episodes. The results underscore the **importance of targeting fiscal stimulus to liquidity-constrained households** to maximize consumption impact, and provide real-time evidence that **intertemporal MPCs during a crisis are large for the cash-poor (who spend quickly) and near-zero for the cash-rich**​

    . This insight is vital for designing effective stimulus and understanding how one-time payments propagate through the economy in a heterogeneous agent framework.
    

Each of these papers contributes to a more nuanced understanding of **heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, intertemporal MPCs, and fiscal policy effectiveness**. Collectively, they emphasize that household differences in wealth, debt, income, and liquidity significantly influence consumption responses to fiscal stimulus. Incorporating such heterogeneity is crucial for both evaluating past stimulus policies and designing future fiscal interventions to achieve desired macroeconomic outcomes.

## Response:
I will conduct a literature search for relevant papers on intertemporal marginal propensity to consume, heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, fiscal policy, and stimulus that have been published since 2010. I will prioritize sources from Google Scholar and include both working papers and preprints in addition to peer-reviewed publications. I will compile a list of papers that are highly relevant to the questions addressed in your paper but are not already cited in your bibliography. I will update you once the research is complete.

    . These findings provide evidence that **highly indebted households have high intertemporal MPCs**, amplifying the effects of tax changes, while wealthier, debt-free households behave in line with forward-looking Ricardian models​
    
    [bankofengland.co.uk](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2014/household-debt-and-the-dynamic-effects-of-income-tax-changes.pdf#:~:text=exogenous%20income%20tax%20changes%20for,evidence%20of%20heterogeneity%20as%20the)
    
    . The paper offers a novel interpretation of how private debt amplifies fiscal policy, suggesting that tax cuts targeted toward borrowers can be especially stimulative in heterogeneous-agent economies.
    
*   **Oh & Reis (2012)** – _Targeted Transfers and the Fiscal Response to the Great Recession._ This paper develops a New Keynesian model with incomplete markets to analyze the role of **targeted lump-sum transfers** (such as tax rebates to specific groups) during a downturn. It finds that such targeted fiscal transfers are strongly **expansionary for aggregate demand** due to a combination of effects​

    . First, there is a **neoclassical wealth effect** (the transfer raises households’ lifetime resources), and second, a **Keynesian aggregate-demand effect** as liquidity-constrained households immediately spend the windfall​
    
    [ideas.repec.org](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/moneco/v59y2012isps50-s64.html#:~:text=Targeted%20lump,a%20Keynesian%20aggregate%20demand%20effect)
    
    . The presence of borrowing-constrained “hand-to-mouth” consumers means that **who pays for and who receives the stimulus matters for the multiplier**. In simulations, transfers directed to poorer, high-MPC agents yield much larger output multipliers than uniform or rich-targeted transfers. This result provided early theoretical insight into why **fiscal stimulus targeted at cash-strapped households can significantly boost consumption** in heterogeneous-agent settings.
    
*   **Zidar (2019)** – _Tax Cuts for Whom? Heterogeneous Effects of Income Tax Changes on Growth and Employment._ This quantitative study uses U.S. state-level variations in the income distribution and federal tax changes to identify how tax cuts for different income groups affect macroeconomic outcomes. It finds that **tax cuts for lower- and middle-income households produce the bulk of aggregate growth** in employment, whereas **tax cuts for the top 10% of earners have little to no effect on job growth**​
    
    [zidar.princeton.edu](https://zidar.princeton.edu/publications/tax-cuts-whom-heterogeneous-effects-tax-changes-growth-and-employment#:~:text=regional%20tax%20shocks%20that%20I,on%20employment%20growth%20is%20small)
    
    . In other words, the positive relationship between tax reductions and economic activity is **driven primarily by tax relief for the bottom 90%**​
    
    [zidar.princeton.edu](https://zidar.princeton.edu/publications/tax-cuts-whom-heterogeneous-effects-tax-changes-growth-and-employment#:~:text=regional%20tax%20shocks%20that%20I,on%20employment%20growth%20is%20small)
    
    . This suggests that high-income households have low MPCs (they tend to save tax windfalls), while lower-income households are more likely to spend extra income, consistent with heterogeneous MPCs. The policy implication is that **fiscal stimulus in the form of broad-based or bottom-weighted tax cuts will be far more effective** in boosting aggregate demand than tax cuts skewed toward the rich.
    
*   **Monacelli & Perotti (2011)** – _Redistribution and the Multiplier._ This theoretical paper asks whether it matters **who bears the fiscal burden** (e.g. which agents face higher taxes) for the size of the government spending multiplier. In a model with borrower (liquidity-constrained) and saver (unconstrained) households, they show that the effect on the multiplier depends on the monetary/fiscal regime​

    . However, with **sticky prices (New Keynesian setting)**, the multiplier is **significantly higher if fiscally constrained (high-MPC) households are spared from bearing the financing costs**, and instead the tax burden falls on savers​

    . This research highlights a “redistribution channel” for fiscal policy: fiscal expansions financed by taxes on wealthier (low-MPC) agents can yield larger multipliers than those financed by taxing poorer (high-MPC) agents, since the latter would cut their consumption more.
    
*   **Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka & White (2017)** – _The Distribution of Wealth and the Marginal Propensity to Consume._ This paper quantitatively explores how matching the empirically observed wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent model affects aggregate MPCs. By introducing a modest degree of heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs, the authors calibrate a model that **matches U.S. wealth inequality** (many households with low wealth and a few with high wealth)​
    
    [econ.jhu.edu](https://econ.jhu.edu/research-highlights/the-distribution-of-wealth-and-the-marginal-propensity-to-consume/#:~:text=In%20a%20model%20calibrated%20to,Our%20model%20also%20plausibly%20predicts)
    
    . The model then endogenously produces an **average MPC far higher than in representative-agent models** – consistent with microeconomic evidence that many households spend a large fraction of windfall income​
    
    [econ.jhu.edu](https://econ.jhu.edu/research-highlights/the-distribution-of-wealth-and-the-marginal-propensity-to-consume/#:~:text=In%20a%20model%20calibrated%20to,Our%20model%20also%20plausibly%20predicts)
    
    . Specifically, the annual MPC in the calibrated heterogenous model is **much larger than the ~0.04 implied by standard macro models**​
    
    [econ.jhu.edu](https://econ.jhu.edu/research-highlights/the-distribution-of-wealth-and-the-marginal-propensity-to-consume/#:~:text=preferences%20or%20beliefs%20is%20sufficient,on%20their%20wealth%2C%20or%20employment)
    
    because a significant share of consumers hold little wealth despite precautionary savings motives (they are “hand-to-mouth” to varying degrees)​
    
    [econ.jhu.edu](https://econ.jhu.edu/research-highlights/the-distribution-of-wealth-and-the-marginal-propensity-to-consume/#:~:text=are%20consistent%20with%20microeconomic%20evidence,their%20wealth%2C%20or%20employment%20status)
    
    . Moreover, the model shows that the **aggregate consumption response to a stimulus depends on how the payment is distributed across households** – for example, giving more to high-MPC (low-wealth or unemployed) households yields a larger total boost in consumption​
    
    [econ.jhu.edu](https://econ.jhu.edu/research-highlights/the-distribution-of-wealth-and-the-marginal-propensity-to-consume/#:~:text=heterogeneity%29,their%20wealth%2C%20or%20employment%20status)
    
    . This work is highly relevant as it demonstrates the importance of wealth heterogeneity for policy multipliers and provides a framework for understanding intertemporal MPC variation in macro models.
    
*   **Lewis, Melcangi & Pilossoph (2021)** – _Latent Heterogeneity in the Marginal Propensity to Consume._ This New York Fed staff report uses an innovative clustering method to estimate the **distribution of individual MPCs** from the 2008 stimulus rebate, without pre-grouping by observable traits. They find that on average, households spent **about one-quarter of the rebate on goods and services** in the first quarter​
    
    [newyorkfed.org](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr902.pdf?sc_lang=en#:~:text=We%20estimate%20the%20unconditional%20distribution,While%20many%20observables)
    
    , but there is **substantial unobserved heterogeneity** in MPCs across households. Interestingly, while some demographics and financial variables (e.g. income, wealth, etc.) correlate with MPC one-by-one, those correlations **largely disappear when considered jointly** – traditional observables can explain **only about 25% of the variation in MPCs**​
    
    [newyorkfed.org](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr902.pdf?sc_lang=en#:~:text=are%20individually%20correlated%20with%20our,the%20role%20of%20unobserved%20heterogeneity)
    
    . This implies the remaining differences are due to latent factors (e.g. preferences, expectations, or other unmeasured constraints). In sum, the paper’s key contribution is showing that **MPC heterogeneity is pervasive and not easily captured by basic household observables**, which has implications for targeting fiscal stimulus: identifying high-MPC groups may be more complex than just using income or age cutoffs.
    
*   **Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel & Yannelis (2020/2023)** – _Income, Liquidity, and the Consumption Response to the 2020 Economic Stimulus Payments._ Using high-frequency transaction data during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines how quickly and how much households spent the CARES Act stimulus checks, and how responses differed by financial situation. The authors document a rapid surge in spending upon receipt of the payments, with households **spending about $0.25–$0.40 of each $1 of stimulus within the first few weeks**​
    
    [econpapers.repec.org](https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:27097#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20The%202020%20CARES%20Act,highlighting%20the%20importance%20of%20targeting)
    
    . However, the MPC is highly heterogeneous: **households with low liquid assets, lower incomes, or recent income drops spent a significantly larger share** of the check, whereas those with ample bank balances **had no significant spending response at all**​
    
    [econpapers.repec.org](https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:27097#:~:text=income%20declines%2C%20and%20liquidity%20as,Households%20that%20expect)
    
    . Liquidity constraints emerge as the strongest predictor of spending – in fact, consumers with large checking account balances mostly saved the transfer, dampening its aggregate effect​
    
    [econpapers.repec.org](https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:27097#:~:text=with%20spending%20increasing%20by%20%240.25,increases%20in%20payments%20like%20rents)
    
    . They also find the composition of spending in 2020 skews more towards food and debt payments (and less towards durable goods) compared to earlier stimulus episodes. The results underscore the **importance of targeting fiscal stimulus to liquidity-constrained households** to maximize consumption impact, and provide real-time evidence that **intertemporal MPCs during a crisis are large for the cash-poor (who spend quickly) and near-zero for the cash-rich**​
    
    [econpapers.repec.org](https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:nbr:nberwo:27097#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20The%202020%20CARES%20Act,Households%20that%20expect)
    
    . This insight is vital for designing effective stimulus and understanding how one-time payments propagate through the economy in a heterogeneous agent framework.
    

Each of these papers contributes to a more nuanced understanding of **heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, intertemporal MPCs, and fiscal policy effectiveness**. Collectively, they emphasize that household differences in wealth, debt, income, and liquidity significantly influence consumption responses to fiscal stimulus. Incorporating such heterogeneity is crucial for both evaluating past stimulus policies and designing future fiscal interventions to achieve desired macroeconomic outcomes.

    . They find multipliers are **much larger when fiscal expansions are financed more by high-income (low-MPC) households** and less by low-income households (reducing crowd-out of private spending). For example, the model’s output multiplier rises from near zero (0.05) when a spending increase is funded evenly across everyone to about **0.33 when funded by only the top 20% of earners**​

    . Crucially, **most of the redistribution came from indirect macro effects** (like the inflation tax eroding older savers’ wealth) rather than from the direct transfers​
    
    [ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2998~fa7fd2487c.en.pdf#:~:text=partly%20unfunded%20by%20future%20taxes%2C,welfare%20of%20some%20actually%20decreased)
    
    . This paper’s key contribution is showing that **even universal stimulus payments can have uneven welfare effects once inflation and debt dynamics are considered**, underscoring the importance of heterogeneous-agent analysis for fiscal policy – a perspective highly relevant to the user’s focus on welfare effects of stimulus policies.
    
*   **Seidl & Seyrich (2023)** – _Unconventional Fiscal Policy as a Substitute for Monetary Policy:_ Seidl and Seyrich prove theoretically that in a Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model, **fiscal policy can replicate the effects of monetary policy when interest rates are constrained**​

    . They derive three conditions involving time-varying consumption taxes, labor taxes, and debt issuance that induce each household to consume and work as if an equivalent interest-rate change had occurred​
    
    [journals.uchicago.edu](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727506#:~:text=policy%20can%20be%20a%20perfect,When%20monetary%20policy%20is)

    . This result is relevant to the user’s research on fiscal stimulus effectiveness, as it highlights how **adjusting tax rates and public debt can stimulate aggregate demand in HA models**, and provides a benchmark for evaluating stimulus tools (like tax cuts) when monetary policy is limited.

    . This cutting-edge work helps explain why recent stimulus checks sparked more inflation than past episodes, and it reinforces the user’s focus on heterogeneous agents by showing how **distribution of fiscal stimulus alters macro outcomes** (inflation and indirectly output).
    
*   **Druedahl, Ravn, Sunder-Plassmann et al. (2024)** – _Fiscal Multipliers in a Small-Open HANK Economy:_ This recent working paper compares fiscal stimulus effects in a **small open economy HANK model vs. a representative-agent model**. They show that under certain conditions (e.g. complete markets or specific hand-to-mouth shares), **the output fiscal multiplier in the HANK model can coincide with that in the RA model at all horizons**​

    . Their contribution suggests that heterogeneity alone may not dramatically change the **magnitude** of fiscal multipliers in an open economy, but it does change the **transmission channels**. This nuance is relevant to the user’s research on stimulus policies: it emphasizes checking whether heterogeneity mainly reallocates the stimulus impact across components (consumption vs. external balance or across household types) rather than simply boosting aggregate GDP effects.

    . These results reinforce a core premise of heterogeneous-agent models: **households’ liquidity constraints and MPCs critically shape macro policy effectiveness**. This paper complements the user’s research by supplying real-world evidence that **the composition of households (savers vs. spenders) matters for the success of fiscal stimulus**, supporting the use of HA macro models in fiscal policy analysis.
    

Each of the above papers was published or circulated after 2020 and addresses **fiscal policy in a heterogeneous-agent context**, making them highly relevant additions to the user’s bibliography. They offer insights into how the distributional aspects of fiscal tools (stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, tax policy, etc.) influence aggregate consumption, output multipliers, and welfare – directly speaking to the research questions on the efficacy and welfare impacts of different stimulus policies.

## Prompt:
I will conduct a literature search for highly relevant but recently published papers (post-2020) that focus specifically on heterogeneous agent macro models and fiscal policy. The search will include working papers and preprints to capture the latest research in the field. I will compile a list of missing relevant papers with citations and a brief summary of each paper’s key contributions and relevance to the user's research. I will update you once the research is complete.

Recent Papers on Heterogeneous-Agent Macro Models and Fiscal Policy (2021–2024)
===============================================================================

*   **Ferrière & Navarro (2024)** – _Tax Progressivity and Fiscal Multipliers:_ Ferrière and Navarro develop a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian model to show how **the distribution of taxes across income groups affects government spending multipliers**​
    
    [axelleferriere.github.io](https://axelleferriere.github.io/files/HEFP_FN_20240301.pdf#:~:text=We%20then%20confirm%20this%20finding,also%20robust%20to%20alternative%20policy)
    
    . They find multipliers are **much larger when fiscal expansions are financed more by high-income (low-MPC) households** and less by low-income households (reducing crowd-out of private spending). For example, the model’s output multiplier rises from near zero (0.05) when a spending increase is funded evenly across everyone to about **0.33 when funded by only the top 20% of earners**​

    . This highlights that **tax/transfer progressivity is crucial for macro effects**, a point directly relevant to evaluating stimulus policies targeted at different income groups in the user’s research.
    
*   **Brzoza-Brzezina, Kolasa & Makarski (2023)** – _Intergenerational Impact of Pandemic Fiscal Stimulus:_ Using a quantitative life-cycle (OLG) model, this ECB working paper examines the **2020–21 pandemic policy mix of large fiscal transfers and easy monetary policy**, with some debt left unpaid (effectively financed by inflation)​
    
    [ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2998~fa7fd2487c.en.pdf#:~:text=partly%20unfunded%20by%20future%20taxes%2C,welfare%20of%20some%20actually%20decreased)
    
    . They find that **young households gained net welfare from the COVID stimulus, while middle-aged and older households “paid the bill,” often ending up worse off despite receiving stimulus checks**​
    
    [ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2998~fa7fd2487c.en.pdf#:~:text=partly%20unfunded%20by%20future%20taxes%2C,welfare%20of%20some%20actually%20decreased)
    
    . Crucially, **most of the redistribution came from indirect macro effects** (like the inflation tax eroding older savers’ wealth) rather than from the direct transfers​
    
    [ecb.europa.eu](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2998~fa7fd2487c.en.pdf#:~:text=partly%20unfunded%20by%20future%20taxes%2C,welfare%20of%20some%20actually%20decreased)
    
    . This paper’s key contribution is showing that **even universal stimulus payments can have uneven welfare effects once inflation and debt dynamics are considered**, underscoring the importance of heterogeneous-agent analysis for fiscal policy – a perspective highly relevant to the user’s focus on welfare effects of stimulus policies.
    
*   **Seidl & Seyrich (2023)** – _Unconventional Fiscal Policy as a Substitute for Monetary Policy:_ Seidl and Seyrich prove theoretically that in a Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model, **fiscal policy can replicate the effects of monetary policy when interest rates are constrained**​
    
    [journals.uchicago.edu](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727506#:~:text=policy%20can%20be%20a%20perfect,When%20monetary%20policy%20is)
    
    . They derive three conditions involving time-varying consumption taxes, labor taxes, and debt issuance that induce each household to consume and work as if an equivalent interest-rate change had occurred​
    
    [journals.uchicago.edu](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727506#:~:text=policy%20can%20be%20a%20perfect,When%20monetary%20policy%20is)
    
    . In other words, a coordinated fiscal package can be a **“perfect substitute” for conventional monetary easing at the zero lower bound**​
    
    [journals.uchicago.edu](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/727506#:~:text=policy%20can%20be%20a%20perfect,When%20monetary%20policy%20is)
    
    . This result is relevant to the user’s research on fiscal stimulus effectiveness, as it highlights how **adjusting tax rates and public debt can stimulate aggregate demand in HA models**, and provides a benchmark for evaluating stimulus tools (like tax cuts) when monetary policy is limited.
    
*   **Kaplan, Nikolakoudis & Violante (2023)** – _Heterogeneity, Deficit Finance, and Inflation (Heterogeneous Fiscal Theory):_ Kaplan et al. study a flexible-price heterogeneous-agent economy to connect household heterogeneity with the fiscal theory of the price level​
    
    [nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31433#:~:text=not%20uniquely%20determined,market%20incompleteness%20in%20determining%20inflation)
    
    . They find that **incomplete markets and high-MPC households greatly amplify the inflationary impact of deficit-financed transfers (“helicopter drops”)**​
    
    [nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31433#:~:text=not%20uniquely%20determined,market%20incompleteness%20in%20determining%20inflation)
    
    . Notably, a **one-time debt-financed transfer raises the price level significantly more in a HA model than in a representative-agent model**, since poorer liquidity-constrained households spend a larger share of the transfer​
    
    [johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2023/10/heterogeneous-agent-fiscal-theory.html#:~:text=Punchline%3A%20In%20the%20heterogeneous%20agent,matters%20who%20gets%20the%20money)
    
    . The effect is even stronger when **transfers are targeted to low-wealth households**, illustrating that \*\*“it matters who gets the money” for aggregate outcomes​
    
    [johnhcochrane.blogspot.com](https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2023/10/heterogeneous-agent-fiscal-theory.html#:~:text=Punchline%3A%20In%20the%20heterogeneous%20agent,matters%20who%20gets%20the%20money)
    
    . This cutting-edge work helps explain why recent stimulus checks sparked more inflation than past episodes, and it reinforces the user’s focus on heterogeneous agents by showing how **distribution of fiscal stimulus alters macro outcomes** (inflation and indirectly output).
    
*   **Druedahl, Ravn, Sunder-Plassmann et al. (2024)** – _Fiscal Multipliers in a Small-Open HANK Economy:_ This recent working paper compares fiscal stimulus effects in a **small open economy HANK model vs. a representative-agent model**. They show that under certain conditions (e.g. complete markets or specific hand-to-mouth shares), **the output fiscal multiplier in the HANK model can coincide with that in the RA model at all horizons**​
