               consumption mistakes (in response to saving changes) lead to
               higher current marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). These
               mistakes increase the value of changing current consumption
               relative to changing saving, as additional saving will not be
               spent optimally. Various behavioral biases can cause these
               mistakes, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic
               expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This
               result helps explain the empirical puzzle of high-liquidity
               consumers’ high MPCs. In my approach, predictions of
               sophistication (anticipation of future mistakes) can be derived
               independently of the underlying biases. (JEL D15, D91, E21)",

                  Leveraging random assignment from a tax lottery, we identify
                  large causal effects of the income windfall, tracking iMPCs
                  for eight months. Revealed-preference estimates from
                  expenditure data align with reported-preference survey results
                  for the same households, underscoring the validity of our data
                  and methods. We observe substantial heterogeneity in MPCs and
                  relate it to observable household characteristics. Households
                  report a higher MPC for unexpected income losses compared to
