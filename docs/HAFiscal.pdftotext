Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics
over four years following an income shock (Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021)), we
assess the effectiveness of three fiscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions.
Unemployment insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck” winner when
effectiveness is measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are second best and have
two advantages (over UI): they arrive faster, and they are scalable to any desired size.
A temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less effective
than the other policies and has negligible effects in the version of our model without a
multiplier.

1 Introduction
{sec:intro}

Fiscal policies that aim to boost consumer spending in recessions have been tried in
many countries in recent decades. The nature of such policies has varied widely, perhaps
because traditional macroeconomic models have not provided plausible guidance about
which policies are likely to be most effective—either in reducing misery (a ‘welfare
metric’) or in increasing output (a ‘GDP metric’).
But a new generation of macro models has shown that when microeconomic heterogeneity across consumer circumstances (wealth; income; education) is taken into account,
the consequences of an income shock for consumer spending depend on a measurable
object: the intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (IMPC) introduced in Auclert, Rognlie, and Straub (2018). The IMPC extends the notion of marginal propensity
to consume (MPC) to account for the speed at which households spend. Fortuitously,
new sources of microeconomic data, particularly from Scandinavian national registries,
have recently allowed the first reasonably credible measurements of the IMPC (Fagereng,
Holm, and Natvik (2021)).
Even in models that can match a given measured IMPC pattern, the relative merits
of alternative policies depend profoundly on the both the metric (welfare or GDP)
and on the quantitative structure of the rest of the model – for example, whether
multipliers exist and how they work. Here, after constructing a microeconomically
credible heterogeneous agent (HA) model, we examine its implications for how optimal
stimulus policies depend on the existence, nature, and timing of any “multipliers,” which,
following Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016), we model in a clean and simple way. As a
result, the interaction of the multiplier (if any) with the other elements of the model is
reasonably easy to understand. In order to ease interpretation of our results, as well as to
keep the model tractable, our primary analysis is based on an aggregation of individual
consumption responses. This partial equilibrium analysis allows us to introduce elements
such as the fact that our multiplier only acts during a recession. However, a general
equilibrium approach may introduce transmission channels that we miss in our primary
analysis. Accordingly, we also analyze a simple HANK and SAM model that embeds
our households’ consumption responses in a general equilibrium framework.1
By “microeconomically credible,” we mean a model that can match three things that
we take to be stylized facts: (1) the measured IMPCs from Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik (2021), (2) the cross-sectional distribution of liquid wealth (following Kaplan
and Violante (2014)’s definition of liquid wealth) and (3) the spending induced by the
unanticipated transitory shock is “front-loaded.” What we mean by this is that a fairly
standard HA model (specifically, the model in Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White
(2017)) can match both the initial distribution of liquid wealth, and the pattern of
spending in periods after the shock arrives. But the prediction of that model for spending
1

The Econ-ARK toolkit with which the model was solved can construct the Jacobians necessary
to connect a steady-state version of the model to the SSJ Toolkit, permitting a full-fledged NK block.
However, we have chosen a partial equilibrium framework in our in our primary analysis because such
a framework allows for a non-linear multiplier. Furthermore, the HANK and SAM model incorporates
many other confounding and confusing elements that do more to obscure than to illuminate our points.

in the initial period is below the actual spending measured. We call the extra spending
that happens immediately in the period of receipt of the stimulus a “splurge.” This
splurge behavior is common across households and independent of their liquid wealth
holdings. As such, it is consistent with the empirical finding that even households with
high liquid wealth have high MPCs in the first quarter.2 The evidence of front-loading
from Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021) is consistent with findings elsewhere in the
literature.3 This ‘splurge’ model is also consistent with evidence, from Ganong and Noel
(2019), that spending drops sharply following the large and predictable drop in income
after the exhaustion of unemployment benefits.4
The resulting structural model could be used to evaluate a wide variety of consumption
stimulus policies. We examine three that have been implemented in recent recessions
in the United States (and elsewhere): an extension of unemployment insurance (UI)
benefits, a means-tested stimulus check, and a payroll tax cut.
Our first metric of policy effectiveness is “multiplication bang for the buck”: For a dollar
of spending on a particular policy, how much multiplication is induced? Timing matters
because in our model (following the empirical literature), the size of any “consumption
multiplier” depends on the economic conditions that prevail when the extra spending
occurs. Our strategy to illuminate this point is twofold. First, we calculate the policyinduced spending dynamics in an economy with no multiplier (and, therefore, with no
multiplication-bang-for-the-buck). We then follow Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016)’s
approach to modeling the aggregate demand externality. In their approach, output
depends mechanically on the level of consumption relative to steady state. But in
contrast to Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016), the aggregate demand externality in
our model is switched on only when the economy is experiencing a recession—there is
no multiplication for spending that occurs after our simulated recession is over. A less
stark assumption (for example, the degree of multiplication depends on the distance of
the economy from its steady state, or the endogenous time-varying multiplication that
arises in a New-Keynesian model) would perhaps be more realistic but also much harder
to assess clearly.
Because our model’s outcomes reflect the behavior of utility-maximizing consumers,
we can calculate another, possibly more interesting, measure of the effectiveness of
2
As well as Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021), Graham and McDowall (2024), Crawley and Kuchler
(2023), and Kueng (2018) among others all provide strong evidence of high MPCs for high-liquid-wealth
households.

Noel (2019).

The logic of Akerlof and Yellen (1985) and Cochrane (1989) suggests the the utility consequences
of such a deviation from perfectly optimal behavior might not be too large. But such behavior might
even be fully rational in a model in which measured consumption includes spending on ‘small durables’
(including many that may not be classified as such in the National Accounts, such as memorable
goods modeled in Hai, Krueger, and Postlewaite (2020)) that would generate splurge-like behavior –
see Browning and Crossley (2009) for a start; see also Laibson, Maxted, and Moll (2022). In addition,
Indarte, Kluender, Malmendier, and Stepner (2024) attributes splurge-like behavior to a form of “present
bias” in which people have time inconsistent preferences; Maxted, Laibson, and Moll (2024) offers a
similar interpretation.

alternative policies: their effect on consumers’ welfare. Even without multiplication,
a utility-based metric can justify countercyclical policy because the larger idiosyncratic
shocks to income that occur during a recession may justify a greater-than-normal degree
of social insurance. We call this ‘welfare bang for the buck.’
The principal difference between the two metrics is that what matters for the degree of
spending multiplication is how much of the policy-induced extra spending occurs during
the recession (when the multiplier matters), while effectiveness in the utility metric also
depends on who is doing the extra spending (because the recession hits some households
much harder than others).
Because high-MPC consumers have high marginal utility, a standard aggregated welfare function would favor redistribution to such consumers even in the absence of a
recession. We are interested in the degree of extra motivation for redistributive policies
present in a recession, so we construct our social welfare metric specifically to measure
only the incremental social welfare effect of alternative policies during recessions (beyond
whatever redistributional logic might apply during expansions – see section 4.3).
Households do not prepare for our “MIT shock” recessions, which double the unemployment rate and the average length of unemployment spells. The end of the recession occurs
as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an average recession length of six quarters, leading
to a return of the unemployment rate to normal levels over time. When the multiplier
is active, any reduction in aggregate consumption below its steady-state level directly
reduces aggregate productivity and thus labor income. Hence, any policy stimulating
consumption will also boost incomes through this aggregate demand multiplier channel.
Our results are intuitive. In the economy with no recession multiplier, the benefit
of a sustained payroll tax cut is negligible.5 When a multiplier exists, the tax cut has
more benefits, especially if the recession continues long enough that most of the spending
induced by the tax cut happens while the economy is still in recession (and the multiplier
still is in force). The typical recession, however, ends long before our “sustained” wage
tax cut is reversed—and even longer before lower-MPC consumers have spent down most
of their extra after-tax income. Accordingly, even in an economy with a multiplier that
is powerful during recessions, much of the wage tax cut’s effect on consumption occurs
when any multiplier that might have existed in a recession is no longer operative.
Even leaving aside any multiplier effects, the stimulus checks have more value than
the wage tax cut, because at least a portion of such checks go to unemployed people who
have both high MPCs and high marginal utilities (while wage tax cuts, by definition, go
only to persons who are employed and earning wages). The greatest “welfare bang for
the buck” comes from the UI insurance extension, because many of the recipients are in
5

One reason there is any (welfare) benefit at all, even for people who have not experienced an
unemployment spell, is that the heightened risk of unemployment during a recession increases the
marginal value of current income because it helps them build extra precautionary reserves to buffer
against the extra risk. A second benefit is that, for someone who becomes unemployed some time into the
recession, the temporary tax reduction will have allowed them to accumulate a larger buffer to sustain
them during unemployment. Finally, in a recession, there are more people who will have experienced a
spell of unemployment, and the larger population of beneficiaries means that the consequences of the
prior mechanism will be greater. But, quantitatively, all of these effects are small.

circumstances in which they have a much higher marginal utility than they would have
had in the absence of the recession, whether or not the multiplier aggregate demand
externality exists.
And, in contrast to the wage-tax cut, both the UI extension and the stimulus checks
concentrate most of the marginal increment to consumption at times when the multiplier
(if it exists) is still powerful. A disadvantage of the UI extension, in terms of “multiplied
bang for the buck,” is that (relative to the assumed-to-be-immediate-upon-recession
checks) it takes somewhat more time until the transfers reach the beneficiaries. Countering this disadvantage is the fact that the MPC of UI recipients is higher than that
of stimulus check recipients, and, furthermore, the insurance nature of the UI payments
reduces the precautionary saving motive. In the end, our model says that these two
forces roughly balance each other, so that the “multiplied bang for the buck” of the two
policies is similar. In the welfare metric, however, there is considerable marginal value
to UI recipients even if they receive some of the benefits after the recession is over (and
no multiplier exists). Hence, in the welfare metric, the relative value of UI benefits is
increased compared with the policy of sending stimulus checks.
We conclude that extended UI benefits should be the first weapon employed from
this arsenal, as they have a greater welfare benefit than stimulus checks and a similar
“multiplied bang for the buck.” But a disadvantage is that the total amount of stimulus
that can be accomplished with the UI extension is constrained by the fact that only a
limited number of people become unemployed. If more stimulation is called for than
can be accomplished via the UI extension, checks have the advantage that their effects
scale almost linearly in the size of the stimulus—see Beraja and Zorzi (2023) for a more
detailed exposition of the relation between MPC and stimulus size. The wage tax cut
is also, in principle, scalable, but its effects are smaller than those of checks because
recipients have lower MPCs and marginal utility than check and UI recipients. In the
real world, a tax cut is also likely the least flexible of the three tools: UI benefits can
be further extended, and multiple rounds of checks can be sent, but multiple rounds
of changes in payroll tax rates would likely be administratively and politically more
difficult.
One theme of our paper is that which policies are better or worse, and by how much,
depends on both the quantitative details of the policies and the quantitative modeling
of the economy.
But the tools we are using could be reasonably easily modified to evaluate a number
of other policies. For example, in the COVID-19 recession in the US, not only was
the duration of UI benefits extended, but those benefits were also supplemented by
substantial extra payments to every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model to
match this particular policy, but the framework could accommodate such an analysis.

1.1 Related literature
{sec:lit}

Several papers have looked at fiscal policies that have been implemented in the U.S. under
the lens of a structural model. Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof, Lalonde,
Laxton, Lindé, Mourougane, Muir, et al. (2012) analyses the effects of different fiscal

4

policies using seven different models. The models are variants of two-agent heterogeneous
agent models and make no attempt to match the full distribution of liquid wealth as we
do in this paper. We also attempt to match the microdata on household consumption
behavior, much of which has come more recently. More closely aligned to the methodology of our paper are McKay and Reis (2016), McKay and Reis (2021), and Phan (2024)
which look at the role of automatic stabilizers. By contrast, we consider discretionary
policies that have been invoked after a recession has begun. Another related paper is
Bayer, Born, Luetticke, and Müller (2023) who studies fiscal policies implemented during
the pandemic. They find that targeted stimulus through an increase in unemployment
benefits has a much larger multiplier than an untargeted policy. In contrast, we find that
untargeted stimulus checks have slightly higher multiplier effects when compared with
a targeted policy extending eligibility for unemployment insurance. Our results derive
from the fact that—as in the data—even high liquid wealth consumers have relatively
high MPCs in our model.
This paper is also closely related to the empirical literature that aims to estimate
the effect of transitory income shocks and stimulus payments. We particularly focus
on Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021), who use Norwegian administrative panel data
with sizable lottery wins to estimate the MPC out of transitory income in that year,
as well as the pattern of expenditure in the following years. We build a model that
is consistent with the patterns they identify. Examples of the literature that followed
the Great Recession in 2008 are Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland (2013) and
Broda and Parker (2014). These papers exploit the effectively random timing of the
distribution of stimulus payments and identify a substantial consumption response. The
results indicate an MPC that is difficult to reconcile with representative agent models.
Thus, the paper relates to the literature presenting HA models that aim to be consistent with the evidence from the micro-data. An example is Kaplan and Violante (2014),
who build a model where agents save in both liquid and illiquid assets. The model yields
a substantial consumption response to a stimulus payment, since MPCs are high both for
constrained, low-wealth households and for households with substantial net worth that
is mainly invested in the illiquid asset (the “wealthy hand-to-mouth”). Carroll, Crawley,
Slacalek, and White (2020) present an HA model that is similar in many respects to the
one we study. Their focus is on predicting the consumption response to the 2020 U.S.
CARES Act that contains both an extension of unemployment benefits and a stimulus
check. However, neither of these papers attempts to evaluate and rank the effectiveness
of different stimulus policies, as we do.
Kaplan and Violante (2022) discuss different mechanisms used in HA models to obtain
a high MPC and the tension between that and fitting the distribution of aggregate
wealth. We use one of the mechanisms they consider, ex-ante heterogeneity in discount
factors, and build a model that delivers both high average MPCs and a distribution of
liquid wealth consistent with the data. The model allows for splurge consumption and
thus also delivers substantial MPCs for high-liquid-wealth households. This helps the
model match not only the initial MPC, but also the propensity to spend out of a windfall
for several periods after it is obtained.
In our model, consumers do not adjust their labor supply in response to the stimulus

5

policies. Our assumption is broadly consistent with the empirical findings in Ganong,
Greig, Noel, Sullivan, and Vavra (2022) and Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2016).
However, the literature is conflicted on this subject and Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2017) and Hagedorn, Karahan, Manovskii, and Mitman (2019) find that extensions
of unemployment insurance affec both search decisions and vacancy creation leading
to a rise in unemployment. Kekre (2022), on the other hand, evaluates the effect of
extending unemployment insurance in the period from 2008 to 2014. He finds that this
extension raised aggregate demand and implied a lower unemployment rate than without
the policy. However, he does not attempt to compare the stimulus effects of extending
unemployment insurance with other policies.
One criterion to rank policies is the extent to which spending is “multiplied,” and
our paper therefore relates to the vast literature discussing the size and timing of any
multiplier. Our focus is on policies implemented in the aftermath of the Great Recession,
a period when monetary policy was essentially fixed at the zero lower bound (ZLB). We
therefore do not consider monetary policy responses to the policies we evaluate in our
primary analysis, and our work thus relates to papers such as Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Rebelo (2011) and Eggertsson (2011), who argue that fiscal multipliers are higher
in such circumstances. Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2019) present an HA model
with both incomplete markets and nominal rigidities to evaluate the size of the fiscal
multiplier and also find that it is higher when monetary policy is constrained. Unlike us,
they focus on government spending instead of transfers and are interested in different
options for financing that spending. Broer, Krusell, and Öberg (2023) also focus on fiscal
multipliers for government spending and show how they differ in representative agent
and HA models with different sources of nominal rigidities. Ramey and Zubairy (2018)
investigate empirically whether there is support for the model-based results that fiscal
multipliers are higher in certain states. While they find evidence that multipliers are
higher when there is slack in the economy or the ZLB binds, the multipliers they find
are still below one in most specifications. In any case, we condition on policies being
implemented in a recession—when, this literature argues, multipliers are higher—but it
is not crucial for our purposes whether the multipliers are greater than one or not. We
are concerned with relative multipliers, and the multiplier is only one of the two criteria
we use to rank policies.
The second criterion to rank policies is our measure of welfare. Thus, the paper relates
to the recent literature on welfare comparisons in HA models. Both Bhandari, Evans,
Golosov, and Sargent (2021) and Dávila and Schaab (2022) introduce ways of decomposing welfare effects. In the former case, these are aggregate efficiency, redistribution
and insurance, while the latter further decomposes the insurance part into intra- and
intertemporal components. These papers are related to ours, but we do not decompose
the welfare effects. Regardless of decomposition, we want to (1) use a welfare measure
as an additional way of ranking policies and (2) introduce a measure that abstracts from
any incentive for a planner to redistribute in the steady state (or “normal” times).

2 Model
{sec:model}

Consumers differ by their level of education and, within education group, by subjective
discount factors (calibrated to match the within-group distribution of liquid wealth). We
first describe each kind of consumer’s problem, given an income process with permanent
and transitory shocks calibrated to their type, as well as type-specific shocks to employment. The next step describes the arrival of a recession and the policies we study as
potential fiscal policy responses. The last section discusses an extension incorporating
aggregate demand effects that induce feedback from aggregate consumption to income
and (via the marginal propensity to consume) back to consumption, amplifying the effect
of a recession when it occurs.
A consumer i has education e(i) and a subjective discount factor βi . The consumer
faces a stochastic income stream, yi,t , and chooses to consume a fraction of that income
when it arrives—the ‘splurge’, described in the introduction. With what is left over,
the consumer chooses to optimize consumption without regard to the fraction that was
already spent. Therefore, consumption each period for consumer i can be written as
ci,t = csp,i,t + copt,i,t ,

(1)

where ci,t is total consumption, csp,i,t is the splurge consumption, and copt,i,t is the
consumer’s optimal choice of consumption after splurging. Splurge consumption is
simply a fraction of income:
csp,i,t = ςyi,t ,
(2)
while the optimized portion of consumption is chosen to maximize the perpetual-youth
lifetime expected-utility-maximizing consumption, where D is the end-of-life probability:
∞
X

βit (1 − D)t E0 u(copt,i,t ).

(3)

t=0

We use a standard CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) utility function, so u(c) =
c1−γ /(1 − γ) for γ ̸= 1 and u(c) = log(c) for γ = 1, where γ is the coefficient of relative
risk aversion. The optimization is subject to the budget constraint, given existing market
resources mi,t and income state, and a no-borrowing constraint:
ai,t = mi,t − ci,t ,
mi,t+1 = Rai,t + yi,t+1 ,
ai,t ≥ 0,
where R is the gross interest factor for accumulated assets ai,t .

2.1 The income process
Consumers face a stochastic income process with permanent and transitory shocks to
income, along with unemployment shocks. In normal times, consumers who become

7

{eq:model}

unemployed receive unemployment benefits for two quarters. Permanent income evolves
according to:
pi,t+1 = ψi,t+1 Γe(i) pi,t ,
(4)
where ψi,t+1 is the shock to permanent income and Γe(i) is the average growth rate of
income for the consumer’s education group e(i).6 The realized growth rate of permanent
income for consumer i is thus Γ̂i,t+1 = ψi,t+1 Γe(i) . The shock to permanent income is
normally distributed with variance σψ2 .
The actual income a consumer receives will be subject to the individual’s employment
status as well as transitory shocks, ξi,t :


ξi,t pi,t , if employed
yi,t = ρb pi,t , if unemployed with benefits
(5)


ρnb pi,t , if unemployed without benefits
where ξi,t is normally distributed with variance σξ2 , and ρb and ρnb are the replacement
rates for an unemployed consumer who is or is not eligible for unemployment benefits,
respectively.
A Markov transition matrix Π generates the unemployment dynamics where the
number of states is given by 2 plus the number of periods that unemployment benefits
last. An employed consumer can continue being employed or move to being unemployed
e(i)
e(i)
e(i)
with benefits.7 The first row of Π is thus given by [1 − πeu , πeu , 0], where πeu indicates
the probability of becoming unemployed from an employed state and 0 is a vector of
zeros of the appropriate length. Note that we allow this probability to depend on
the education group of consumer i and will calibrate this parameter to match the
average unemployment rate for each education group. Upon becoming unemployed, all
consumers face a probability πue of transitioning back into employment and a probability
1 − πue of remaining unemployed with one less period of remaining benefits. After
transitioning into the unemployment state where the consumer is no longer eligible for
benefits, the consumer will remain in this state until becoming employed again. The
probability of becoming employed is thus the same for each of the unemployment states
and education groups.

2.2 Recessions and policies
We model the arrival of a recession, and the government policy response to it, as an
unpredictable event—an MIT shock. We have four types of shocks: one representing a
recession and one for each of the three different policy responses we consider. The policy
6

We model the rate of growth for permanent income for each education group and keep this rate
unchanged during periods of unemployment. There is evidence, e.g. in Davis and Wachter (2011), that
unemployment, especially in a recession, leads to permanent income loss. This finding could be added
to the model—see Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, and White (2020) for an example—but is not material to
the evaluation of stimulus payments here so we have chosen to keep the model simple.
7
That is, as long as we assume that there is at least one period of unemployment benefits.

8

{sec:recessions}

responses are usually modeled as in addition to the recession, but we also consider
a counterfactual in which the policy response occurs without a recession in order to
understand the welfare effects of the policy.
Recession. At the onset of a recession, several changes occur. First, the unemployment
rate for each education group doubles: Those who would have been unemployed in the
absence of a recession are still unemployed, and an additional number of consumers move
from employment to unemployment. Second, conditional on the recession continuing,
the employment transition matrix is adjusted so that unemployment remains at the new
high level and the expected length of time for an unemployment spell increases. In
our baseline calibration, discussed in detail in section 3.3.1, we set the expected length
of an unemployment spell to one and a half quarters in normal times, and this length
increases to four quarters in a recession. Third, the end of the recession occurs as a
Bernoulli process calibrated for an average length of recession of six quarters. Finally,
at the end of a recession, the employment transition matrix switches back to its original
probabilities, and, as a result, the unemployment rate trends down over time, back to
its steady-state level.
Policies. The policies we consider in response to a recession are inspired by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The former included means tested stimulus checks
in the form of tax rebates, and the latter included both an extension of unemployment
benefits and a tax cut. Based on these examples we therefore consider the following
stimulus policies in our framework:
1. Stimulus check. In this policy response, the government sends money to every
consumer that directly increases the household’s market resources. The checks are
means-tested depending on permanent income. A check for $1,200 is sent to every
household with permanent income less than $100,000, and this amount is then linearly
reduced to zero for households with a permanent income greater than $150,000. Similar
policies were implemented in the U.S. in 2001, 2008, and during the pandemic.
2. Extended unemployment benefits. In this policy response, unemployment benefits are extended from two quarters to four quarters. That is, those who become
unemployed at the start of the recession, or who were already unemployed, will receive
unemployment benefits for up to four quarters (including quarters leading up to the
recession). Those who become unemployed one quarter into the recession will receive up
to three quarters of unemployment benefits. These extended unemployment benefits will
occur regardless of whether the recession ends, and no further extensions are granted if
the recession continues. This policy reflects temporary changes made to unemployment
benefits in the U.S. following the great recession.

9

3. Payroll tax cut. In this policy response, employee-side payroll taxes are reduced for
a period of eight quarters.8 During this period, which continues irrespective of whether
the recession continues or ends, employed consumers’ income is increased by 2 percent.
The income of the unemployed is unchanged by this policy. Households also believe
there is a 50-50 chance that the tax cut will be extended by another two years if the
recession has not ended when the first tax cut expires.9 The payroll tax cut introduced
in the U.S. in 2010 was itself an extension of previously implemented cuts and had a
two-year horizon.
Financing the policies. Some work in the HA macro literature has shown that if taxes
are raised immediately to offset any fiscal stimulus, results can be very different than
they would be if, as occurs in reality, recessionary policies are debt financed. However,
typical fiscal rules assume that any increase in debt gets financed over a long interval.
Accordingly, almost all of the effects of any particular fiscal rule will be similar for each of
our policies so long as the great majority of the debt is repaid after the short recessionary
period that is our main focus.
To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we do not model the debt repayment. Any
of a variety of fiscal rules could be imposed for the period following our short period of
interest, but we did not want to choose any particular fiscal rule in order to avoid making
a choice that has little consequence for our key question. Advocates of alternative fiscal
rules likely already have intuitions about how such rules’ economic consequences differ,
but those consequences—under our partial equilibrium analysis—will be similar for all
three policies we consider. Alternative choices of fiscal rules will therefore not affect the
ranking of policies that is our principal concern.10

2.3 Aggregate demand effects
Our baseline model is a partial equilibrium model that does not include any feedback
from aggregate consumption to income. In an extension to the model, we add aggregate
demand effects during the recession. The motivation for this specification comes from
the idea that spending in an economy with substantial slack and in which the central
bank is unable to prevent a recession will result in higher utilization rates and greater
output. By contrast, government spending in an economy running at potential with
an active monetary policy will not succeed in increasing output. The recent inflation
experience of the U.S. provides some evidence that output responds highly non-linearly
to aggregate demand. This idea is explored in a recent revival of research into non-linear
Phillips curves, such as Benigno and Eggertsson (2023) and Blanco, Boar, Jones, and
Midrigan (2024).
8

Although payroll taxes are paid by both the employer and the employee, the payroll tax cuts in
the U.S. have been applied only the employee side.
9
The belief that the payroll tax cut may be extended makes little difference to the results.
10
In our general equilibrium analysis in section 5, we apply a fiscal rule that assumes debt is slowly
paid back over time.

The series yAD,i,t is then used for each consumer’s budget constraint.

3 Parameterizing the model
This section describes how we set the model’s parameters. First, we estimate the extent
to which consumers ‘splurge’ when receiving an income shock. Given the lack of empirical
evidence of the marginal propensity to consume over time for the US, we use instead
Norwegian data to estimate the splurge. Specifically, we calibrate our model to the
Norwegian economy and match evidence from Norway on the profile of the marginal
propensity to spend over time and across different wealth levels, as provided by Fagereng,
Holm, and Natvik (2021).11
Second, we set up the full model on U.S. data, taking the splurge factor as given
from the Norwegian estimation In the full model, agents differ according to their level
of education and their subjective discount factors. A subset of the parameters in the
model are calibrated equally for all types, and some parameters are calibrated to be
specific to each education group. Finally, a distribution of subjective discount factors is
estimated separately for each education group to match features of each within-group
liquid wealth distribution.

3.1 Estimation of the splurge factor
The splurge allows us to capture the shorter- and longer-term response of consumption
to income shocks, especially for consumers with significant liquid wealth. The main
aim of this paper, however, is to rank consumption stimulus policies, not to provide
a microfoundation for the splurging behavior. We view the splurge factor as a model
device that enables us to rank the policies in a model that is consistent with the best
available micro-evidence of spending patterns over time after a transitory income shock.
In appendix A we provide results from our model without a splurge factor. There we
show that such a model provides a worse fit to the moments in the data that we are

11

Appendix A discusses an alternative calibration method, which solely relies on US data. The main
results derived in that calibration are in line with those discussed in the main text.

interested in, but not dramatically so, and that our conclusions regarding the ranking
of the policies are not affected.
The specific exercise we carry out in this section, is to show that our model can
account well for the results of Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021), who study the effect of
lottery winnings in Norway on consumption using millions of records from the Norwegian
population registry. We calibrate our model to reflect the Norwegian economy and, using
their results, estimate the splurge factor, as well as the distribution of discount factors
in the population, to match two empirical moments.
First, we take from Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021) the marginal propensity to
consume out of a one-period income shock. We target not only the initial (aggregate)
response of consumption to the income shock, but also the subsequent effect on consumption in years one through four after the shock. We also target the initial consumption
response in the cross-section, i.e. across the quartiles of the liquid wealth distribution,
for which empirical estimates are also provided. The shares of lottery winnings expended
at different time horizons, as found in Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021), are plotted
in figure 10a. Table 1 (second row) shows the initial consumption response across liquid
wealth quartiles.
Second, we match the steady-state distribution of liquid wealth in the model to its
empirical counterpart. Because of the lack of data on the liquid wealth distribution in
Norway, we use the corresponding data from the United States, assuming that liquid
wealth inequality is comparable across these countries.12 Specifically, we impose as
targets the cumulative liquid wealth shares for the entire population at the 20th, 40th,
60th, and 80th income percentiles, which, in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances
(SCF) in 2004 (see section 3.2 for further details), equal 0.03 percent, 0.35 percent, 1.84
percent, and 7.42 percent, respectively. Hence, 92.6 percent of the total liquid wealth is
held by the top income quintile. We also target the mean liquid wealth to income ratio
of 6.60. The data are plotted in figure 10b.
For this estimation exercise, the remaining model parameters are calibrated to reflect
the Norwegian economy. Specifically, we set the real interest rate to 2 percent annually
and the unemployment rate to 4.4 percent, in line with Aursland, Frankovic, Kanik,
12
Data from the Norwegian tax registry contains information on liquid assets, but not liquid debt.
Only total debt is reported – which is mainly mortgage debt. Therefore, we cannot construct liquid
wealth as Kaplan and Violante (2014) can for the U.S.

and Saxegaard (2020). The quarterly probability to survive is calibrated to 1 − 1/160,
reflecting an expected working life of 40 years. Aggregate productivity growth is set
to 1 percent annually, following Kravik and Mimir (2019). The unemployment net
replacement rate is calibrated to 60 percent, following OECD (2020). Finally, we set
the real interest rate on liquid debt to 13.6 percent, following data from the Norwegian
debt registry Gjeldsregistret (2022).13
Estimates of the standard deviations of the permanent and transitory shocks are
taken from Crawley, Holm, and Tretvoll (2022), who estimate an income process on
administrative data for Norwegian males from 1971 to 2014. The estimated annual
variances for the permanent and transitory shocks are 0.004 and 0.033, respectively.14
As in Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2020), these are converted to
quarterly values by multiplying the permanent and transitory shock variances by 1/4
and 4, respectively. Thus, we obtain quarterly standard deviations of σψ = 0.0316 and
σξ = 0.363.
Using the calibrated model, we simulated unexpected lottery winnings and calculate
the share of the lottery spent in each year. Specifically, each simulated agent receives a
lottery win in a random quarter of the first year of the simulation. The size of the lottery
win is itself random and spans the range of lottery sizes found in Fagereng, Holm, and
13

Specifically, we determine the average volume-weighted interest rate on liquid debt, which consists
of consumer loans, credit and payment card debt and all other unsecured debt. We use data from
December 2019. Note that although these data let us pin down aggregate quantities, they do not solve
the issue referred to in footnote 12, since we cannot link them to the tax registry at the individual level.
We set the borrowing limit on liquid debt to zero.
14
As shown in Crawley, Holm, and Tretvoll (2022), an income process of the form that we use here
is more accurately estimated using moments in levels not differences. Hence, we take the numbers from
column 3 of their table 4.

Natvik (2021). The estimation procedure minimizes the distance between the target and
model moments by selecting the splurge factor and the distribution of discount factors
in the population, where the latter are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range
[β − ∇, β + ∇]. We approximate the uniform distribution of discount factors with a
discrete approximation and let the population consist of eight different types.
The estimation yields a splurge factor of 0.249 and a distribution of discount factors
described by β = 0.968 and ∇ = 0.0578. Given these estimated parameters and the
remaining calibrated ones, the model is able to replicate the time path of consumption
in response to a lottery win from Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021) and the targeted
distribution of liquid wealth very well, see Figure 1. Also, the targeted moments
discussed in Table 1 are captured relatively well. In particular, the model is able to
account for the empirical fact that MPC consume for high-wealth agents is substantially
larger than zero, see the first column.

3.2 Data on permanent income, liquid wealth, and education
Before we move on to the parameterization of the full model, we describe in detail the
data that we use to get measures of permanent income, liquid wealth, and the division of
households into educational groups in the United States. We use data on the distribution
of liquid wealth from the 2004 wave of the SCF. We restrict our attention to households
where the head is of working age, which we define to be in the range from 25 to 62.
The SCF-variable “normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent
income, and, to exclude outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5
percent of the distribution of this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for
households in our sample is thus $16,708.
Liquid wealth is defined as in Kaplan and Violante (2014) and consists of cash, money
market, checking, savings, and call accounts; directly held mutual funds; and stocks and
bonds. We subtract off liquid debt, which is the revolving debt on credit card balances.
Note that the SCF does not contain information on cash holdings, so these are imputed
with the procedure described in Appendix B.1 of Kaplan and Violante (2014), which
also describes the credit card balances that are considered part of liquid debt. We drop
any households that have negative liquid wealth.
Households are classified into three educational groups. The first group, “Dropout,”
applies to households where the head of household has not obtained a high school
diploma; the second group, “Highschool,” includes heads of households who have a
high school diploma and those who, in addition, have some years of college education
without obtaining a bachelor’s degree; and the third group, “College,” consists of heads
of households who have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher. With this classification
of the education groups, the Dropout group makes up 9.3 percent of the population, the
Highschool group 52.7 percent, and the College group 38.0 percent.
With our sample selection criteria, we are left with a sample representing about 61.3
million U.S. households.

3.3 Parameters in the full model
{sec:paramsFull}

With households classified into the three education groups using the SCF data, we
proceed to set the parameters of the model as follows. First, we calibrate a set of parameters that apply to all types of houesholds in the model. Second, we calibrate another
set of parameters that are specific to each education group to capture broad differences
across these groups. Finally, given the calibrated parameters we estimate discount factor
distributions for each education group that allow us to match the distribution of liquid
wealth in each group.
The model is a simplified model for households in that we do not take into account
heterogeneity across household size or composition. The households are ex-ante heterogeneous in their subjective discount factors as well as their level of education. We classify
the education level of the household based on the education of the head of the household,
and we typically think of individual characteristics as applying to that person.
A period in the model is one quarter. This choice makes it realistic to consider stimulus
policies that are implemented in the same period as a recession starts.
3.3.1 Calibrated parameters
Panel A of table 2, lists parameters that are calibrated equally across all types in the
model. Panel B of table 2, lists parameters in the model that are education specific. For
completeness, panel C of table 2 summarizes the parameters describing how we model
a recession and the three policies we consider as potential responses to a recession.
Preferences, survival and interest rates. All households are assumed to have a
coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to γ = 2. We also assume that all households
have the same propensity to splurge out of transitory income gains and set ς = 0.249,
the value estimated in section 3.1. However, each education group is divided into types
that differ in their subjective discount factors. The distributions of discount factors for
each education group are estimated to fit the distribution of liquid wealth within that
group, and this estimation is described in detail in section 3.3.2. Regardless of type,
households face a constant survival probability each quarter. This probability is set to
1 − 1/160, reflecting an expected working life of 40 years. The real interest rate on
households’ savings is set to 1 percent per quarter.
Labor market risk while employed. When consumers are born, they receive
an initial level of permanent income. This initial value is drawn from a log-normal
distribution that depends on the education level the household is born with. For each
education group, the parameters of the distribution are determined by the mean and
standard deviation of log-permanent income for households in that group where the head
of the household is of age 25 in the SCF 2004. For the Dropout group, the mean initial
value of quarterly permanent income is $6,200; for the Highschool group, it is $11,100;
and for the College group, it is $14,500. The standard deviations of the log-normal
distributions for each group are, respectively, 0.32, 0.42, and 0.53.
While households remain employed, their income is subject to both permanent and
transitory idiosyncratic shocks. These shocks are distributed equally for the three

education groups. The standard deviations of these shocks are taken from Carroll,
Crawley, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White (2020), who set the standard deviations of the
transitory and permanent shocks to σξ = 0.346 and σψ = 0.0548, respectively.
Permanent income also grows, on average, with a growth rate Γe(i) that depends on
the level of education. These average growth rates are based on numbers from Carroll,
Crawley, Slacalek, and White (2020), who construct age-dependent expected permanent
income growth factors using numbers from Cagetti (2003) and fit the age-dependent
numbers to their life-cycle model. We construct the quarterly growth rates of permanent
income in our perpetual-youth model by taking the average of the age-dependent growth
rates during a household’s working life. The average gross quarterly growth rates that
we obtain for the three education groups are then Γd = 1.0036, Γh = 1.0045, and
Γc = 1.0049.
Unemployment. Consumers also face the risk of becoming unemployed and will then
have access to unemployment benefits for a certain period. The parameters describing
the unemployment benefits in normal times are based on the work of Rothstein and
Valletta (2017), who study the effects on household income of unemployment and of
running out of eligibility for benefits. The unemployment benefits replacement rate is
thus set to ρb = 0.7 for all households, and when benefits run out, the unemployment
replacement rate without any benefits is set to ρnb = 0.5. These replacement rates are
set as a share of the households’ permanent income and are based on the initial drop
in income upon entering an unemployment spell, presented in figure 3 in Rothstein and
Valletta (2017).15
The duration of unemployment benefits in normal times is set to two quarters, so that
our Markov transition matrix Π has four states. This length of time corresponds to the
mean duration of unemployment benefits across U.S. states from 2004 to mid-2008 of 26
weeks, reported by Rothstein and Valletta (2017).
The probability of transitioning out of unemployment is set to match the average
duration of an unemployment spell in normal times. In data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, this average duration was 19.6 weeks or 1.5 quarters in 2004. We do not
have data on education-specific duration rates, however, so we set the average duration
of unemployment to 1.5 quarters for all households. This implies that the transition
probability from unemployment to employment is set to πue = 2/3.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics provide data on unemployment rates for different
education groups, and we match the average rate in each group in 2004 by setting
an education-specific probability of transitioning from employment into unemployment.
Note that this calibration strategy is consistent with the results in Mincer (1991) who
finds that the main difference between education groups is in the incidence of unemploy15

See the lines for their UI exhaustee sample including and excluding UI income. Rothstein and
Valletta (2017) also point out that “UI benefits replace about 40 percent of the lost earnings on average”
(page 894). For a household with two income earners with equal income, these findings would mean
that income drops to 70 percent when one earner becomes unemployed and to 50 percent when benefits
run out. In this paper we ignore several of the channels studied by Rothstein and Valletta (2017) such
as within household insurance and other social programs that can provide income even after UI benefits
have run out.

ment, and not its duration.16 More recent work by Elsby and Hobijn (2010) includes
data upto 2009 and echoes Mincer’s results.
The average unemployment rate in 2004 was 8.5 percent for the Dropout group, 4.4
percent for the Highschool group, and 2.7 percent for the College group. These values
imply that the probabilities of transitioning into unemployment in normal times are
d

c
πeu
= 6.2 percent, πeu

Finally, the strength of the aggregate demand effect in recessions is determined by the
consumption elasticity of productivity. We follow Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016)
and set this to κ = 0.3.
3.3.2 Estimating the discount factor distributions
Discount factor distributions are estimated separately for each education group to match
the distribution of liquid wealth for households in that group. To do so, we let each
education group consist of types that differ in their subjective discount factor, β. The
discount factors within each group e ∈ {d, h, c} are assumed to be uniformly distributed
in the range [βe − ∇e , βe + ∇e ]. The parameters βe and ∇e are chosen for each group
separately to match the median liquid-wealth-to-permanent-income ratio and the 20th,
40th, 60th, and 80th percentile points of the Lorenz curve for liquid wealth for that
group. We approximate the uniform distribution of discount factors with a discrete
approximation and let each education group consist of seven different types.
Panel A of table 3 shows the estimated values of (βe , ∇e ) for each education group.
The panel also shows the minimum and maximum values of the discount factors we
actually use in the model when we use a discrete approximation with seven values to
approximate the uniform distribution of discount factors. Panel B of table 3 shows
that with these estimated distributions, we can exactly match the median liquid-wealthto-permanent-income ratios for each education group. Figure 2 shows that with the
estimated distributions, the model quite closely matches the distribution of liquid wealth
within each education group as well as for the population as a whole. Thus, our model
does not suffer from the “missing middle” problem, identified in Kaplan and Violante
(2022), in which the middle of the wealth distribution has too little wealth.
One point we should note concerns the estimated discount factor distribution for the
Highschool group. Panel A of table 3 reports values of βh = 0.911 and ∇h = 0.137. With
these values, the largest discount factors in our discrete approximation of the uniform
distribution in the range [βh − ∇h , βh + ∇h ] would be greater than 1. More importantly,
16
Mincer (1991) states that “the reduction of the incidence of unemployment [at higher education
levels] is found to be far more important than the reduced duration of unemployment in creating the
educational differentials in unemployment rates” (page 1).
17
Also note that the probability of transitioning from employment to unemployment is the probability
of a job separation times the conditional probability of unemployment given a job separation. Mincer
(1991) reports that both of these are lower for higher education levels. For our calibration, this means
that a higher job finding rate within the quarter of the job separation for more educated workers
translates into a lower probability of transitioning from employment to unemployment during a quarter.
In that sense, our calibration is consistent with short-term job-finding rates being higher for more
educated workers.

Note: Panel (A) shows the estimated parameters of the discount distributions for each education
group. It also shows the minimum and maximum values we use in our discrete approximation to
the uniform distribution of discount factors for each group. The ∗ indicates that the highest value
in the uniform distribution of discount factor values violates the growth impatience condition
(GIC) and has been replaced. Panel (B) shows the weighted median ratio of liquid wealth to
permanent income from the 2004 SCF and in the model. In the annual data from the SCF, the
annual PI is divided by 4 to obtain a quarterly number.

the value would violate the Growth Impatience Condition (GIC), discussed in Carroll
(2022). (The GIC is required to prevent the ratio of total wealth to total income of any
group from approaching infinity. It does this by making sure that the growth of wealth
of the group is less than or equal to the growth of income.) We replace values violating
the GIC with values close to the upper bound on β imposed by the GIC. In panel A of
table 3 the largest value is marked by a ∗ to indicate that it has been replaced to avoid
violating the GIC. We always impose that the GIC is satisfied in the estimation of the
discount factor distributions, but for the baseline parameter values it is only binding
for the Highschool group. Thus, the estimation can select a large value of ∇h without
violating the constraint.18
Also, note that several of the types in the Dropout group have very low discount
factors and are very impatient. In this way, the model fits the feature of the data for the
Dropout group that the bottom quintiles do not save at all and do not accumulate any
liquid wealth. Very low estimates for discount factors are in line with those obtained in
the literature on payday lending.19
The constraint is imposed by calculating a discount factor β GIC where the GIC holds with equality.
Then the estimation can pick how close to this value the largest discount factor is by estimating x and
setting the largest discount factor to exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))β GIC .
19
See, for example, Skiba and Tobacman (2008), who estimate two-week discount rates of 21 percent,
and Allcott, Kim, Taubinsky, and Zinman (2021), who estimate an initial period discount factor between

3.3.3 Implications for non-targeted moments
Before we move on to compare different consumption stimulus policies in the calibrated
model, we also report implications of the model for some non-targeted moments. Panel A
of table 4 shows the wealth distribution across the three education groups in the data
and in the model. The model matches these shares quite closely, which may not be
surprising given that we calibrate the size of each group and we manage to fit the wealth
distribution within each group separately. The panel also reports the average marginal
propensity to consume for the different groups. To be comparable to numbers reported
in Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik (2021), these are calculated as the average MPC in the
year of a lottery win. Lottery wins occur in a random quarter of the year that differs
across individuals. The MPC for an individual depends on the spending pattern after
the win, and these are averaged across individuals within each education group.
0.74 and 0.83 in a model where a period is eight weeks long. Both of these papers use quasi-hyperbolic
preferences, so the estimates are not directly comparable with parameters in our model. Nevertheless,
they support the point that very high discount rates are necessary to model the part of the population
that takes out payday loans at very high interest rates.

{sec:nonTargetedMo

Panel B of table 4 shows similar numbers to Panel A, sorted by quartiles of the
liquid wealth distribution instead of education groups. Our model yields a slightly more
concentrated liquid wealth distribution than in the data. However, it does produce
a fairly high MPC even for households in the highest quartile of the liquid wealth
distribution. This is consistent with the results found in the Norwegian data by Fagereng,
Holm, and Natvik (2021), but also with recent results in Graham and McDowall (2024).
In an administrative dataset from a large US financial institution, they find that the
spending response to an income receipt is large across the distribution of liquid asset
holdings. In our model, we obtain this result due to the inclusion of the splurge factor.
As shown in Appendix A, the model is not able to generate a high MPC for the highest
wealth quartile without splurge consumption.

Note: Panel (A) shows percent of liquid wealth held by each education group in the 2004 SCF
and in the model. It also shows the average MPCs after a lottery win for each education group.
The MPCs are calculated for each individual for the year of a lottery win, taking into account
that the win takes place in a random quarter of the year that differs across individuals. The
MPCs are averaged across individuals within each education group. Panel (B) shows the same
numbers for the population sorted into different quartiles of the liquid wealth distribution.

Finally, we consider the implications of our model for two different patterns of spending
over time. The first pattern is the dynamics of spending after a lottery win from
Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik. This pattern was used in the estimation of the splurge
factor in section 3.1, but was not targeted when estimating the discount factor distributions for each education group in section 3.3.2. Figure 3a shows that the model that is
estimated taking the value of the splurge as given, results in a distribution of spending
over time that is very similar to the one found in the Norwegian data.

21

The second pattern concerns the dynamics of income and spending for households that
become unemployed and remain unemployed long enough for unemployment benefits
to expire. Figure 3b shows the pattern of income and spending for such households.
Ganong and Noel (2019) report the empirical result that nondurable spending drops by
12 percent the month when benefits expire. Our quarterly model is broadly consistent
with this, and the drop in spending the quarter after the expiry of UI benefits is 18
percent.

4 Comparing fiscal stimulus policies
In this section, we present our results where we compare three policies to provide fiscal
stimulus in our calibrated model. The policies we compare are a means-tested stimulus
check, an extension of unemployment benefits, and a payroll tax cut. Each policy is
implemented at the start of a recession, and we compare results both with and without
aggregate demand effects being active during the recession. First, we present impulse
responses of aggregate income and consumption after the implementation of each policy.
Then we compare the policies in terms of their cumulative multipliers and in terms of
their effect on a welfare measure that we introduce. Finally, based on these comparisons,
we can rank the three policies.

22

{sec:comparing}

4.1 Impulse responses
The impulse responses that we present for each stimulus policy are constructed as follows:
• A recession hits in quarter one.
• We compute the subsequent path for the economy without any policy introduced
in response to the recession.
• We also compute the subsequent path for the economy with a given policy introduced at the onset of the recession in quarter one.
• The impulse responses we present are then the difference between these two paths
for the economy and show the effect of a policy relative to a case where no policy
was implemented.
• The solid lines show these impulse responses for an economy where the aggregate
demand effects described in section 2.3 are not active, and the dashed lines show
impulse responses for an economy where the aggregate demand effects are active
during the recession.
• Red lines refer to aggregate labor and transfer income, and blue lines refer to
consumption.
Note that all graphs show the average response of income and consumption for recessions of different length. Specifically, we simulate recessions lasting from only one
quarter up to 20 quarters. We then take the sum of the results across all recession lengths
weighted by the probability of this recession length occurring (given our assumption of
an average recession length of six quarters).
4.1.1 Stimulus check
Figure 4 shows the impulse response of income and consumption when stimulus checks
are issued in the first quarter of a recession. In the model without a multiplier, the
stimulus checks account for 5 percent of the first quarter’s income. In the following
quarters, there are no further stimulus payments, and income remains the same as it
would have been without the stimulus check policy. Consumption is about 2.5 percent
higher in the first quarter, which includes the splurge response to the stimulus check.
Consumption then drops to less than 1 percent above the counterfactual, and the
remainder of the stimulus check money is then spent over the next few years. In the
model with aggregate demand effects, income in the first quarter is 6 percent higher than
the counterfactual, as the extra spending feeds into higher incomes. Consumption in this
model jumps to a higher level than without aggregate demand effects and comes down
more slowly as the feedback effects from consumption to income dampen the speed with
which income—and hence the splurge—return to zero. After a couple of years, when the
recession is most likely over and aggregate demand effects are no longer in place, income
is close to where it would be without the stimulus check policy, although consumption
remains somewhat elevated.

Figure 4 Impulse responses of aggregate income and consumption to a stimulus
check during recessions with and without aggregate demand effects
4.1.2 UI extension
The impulse responses in figure 5 show the response to a policy that extends unemployment benefits from 6 months to 12 months for a period of a year. In the model without
aggregate demand effects, the path for income now depends on the number of consumers
who receive the extended unemployment benefits. These consumers are those who have
been unemployed for between 6 and 12 months. In the first quarter of the recession,
the newly unemployed receive unemployment benefits regardless of whether they are
extended or not. Therefore, it is in the second and third quarters, when the effects
of the recession on long-term unemployment start to materialize, that the extended
UI payments ramp up, amounting to an aggregate increase in quarterly income by
0.7 percent. By the fifth quarter, the policy is no longer in effect, and income from
extended unemployment goes to zero. Consumption in the first quarter jumps by more
than income (by 0.3 percent), prompted by both the increase in expected income and
the reduced need for precautionary saving given the extended insurance. In the model
without aggregate demand effects, consumption is only a little above the counterfactual
by the time the policy is over. In the model with aggregate demand effects, there is
an extra boost to income of about the same size in the first and second quarters. As
this extra aggregate demand induced income goes to employed consumers, more of it is
saved, and consumption remains elevated several quarters beyond the end of the policy.

4.1.3 Payroll tax cut
The final impulse response graph, figure 6, shows the impulse response for a payroll tax
cut that persists for two years (eight quarters). In the model without aggregate demand
effects, income rises by close to 2 percent as the take-home pay for employed consumers
goes up. After the two-year period, income drops back to where it would have been
without the payroll tax cut. Consumption jumps close to 1 percent in response to the
tax cut. Over the period in which the tax cut is in effect, consumption rises somewhat as
the stock of precautionary savings goes up. Following the drop in income, consumption
drops sharply because of the splurge and then decreases over time as consumers spend
out the savings they built up over the period the tax cut was in effect. In the model with
aggregate demand effects, income rises by about 2.3 percent above the counterfactual
and then declines steadily as the probability that the recession remains active—and
hence the aggregate demand effects in place—goes down over time. Following the end
of the policy, the savings stock in the model with aggregate demand effects is high, and
consumption remains significantly elevated through the period shown.

4.2 Multipliers
In this section, we compare the fiscal multipliers across the three stimulus policies.
Specifically, we employ the cumulative multiplier, which captures the ratio between the

net present value (NPV) of stimulated consumption up to horizon t and the full-horizon
NPV of the cost of the policy. We thus define the cumulative multiplier up to horizon t
as
N P V (t, ∆C)
,
(8)
M (t) =
N P V (∞, ∆G)
where ∆C is the additional aggregate consumption spending up to time t in the policy
scenario relative to the baseline and ∆G is the total government expenditure
caused by
Pt  Q s 1 
the policy. The NPV of a variable Xt is given by N P V (t, X) = s=0
i=1 Ri Xs .
The multiplier hence captures the amount of induced consumption at different horizons
relative to the total (i.e. full-horizon) cost of the policies.
Figure 7 plots the cumulative multipliers at different horizons, and table 5 shows the
10y-horizon multiplier for each policy. The stimulus check, which is paid out in quarter
one, exhibits the largest multiplier on impact. About 50 percent of the total policy
expenditure is immediately spent by consumers. After two years, and because of the
aggregate demand effects, consumption has increased cumulatively by more than the
cost of the stimulus check. Over time, the policy reaches a total multiplier of 1.199.
Without AD effects the policy only generates a multiplier of 0.854. The last two rows in
table 5 show the expected share of the policy expenditures and stimulated consumption
that occurs during a recession. For the stimulus check all of the policy expenditures

occur in the first quarter and thus with certainty during the recession. However, since
induced consumption also takes place during later periods at which time the recession
may have already ended, the share of stimulated consumption during the recession is
lower at 75%.
Since spending for the UI policy is spread out over four quarters (and peaks in quarters
two to three), the multiplier in the first quarter is considerably lower than in the case
of the stimulus check. However, the UI extension policy is targeted in the sense that
it provides additional income to only those consumers, who, because of unemployment,
have large MPCs. Also, over the medium-term UI extension expenditures are more likely
to induce consumption spending during the recession compared to the check stimulus,
see the last row in table 5. This is because UI extension expenditures affect agents
who spent the additional income relatively quickly once it reaches them. Therefore, the
cumulative mulitiplier of the UI extension exceeds that of the stimulus check after about
one year.
The payroll tax cut has the lowest multiplier irrespective of the considered horizon. A
multiplier of close to 1 is reached only after 10 years with AD effects. These relatively
small numbers reflect that policy spending lasts for a long time and is thus more likely
to occur after the recession has ended. Moreover, only employed consumers, often with
relatively low MPCs, benefit directly from the payroll tax cut. Therefore, the policy is
poorly targeted if the goal is to provide short-term stimulus.

consider a “first-round” aggregate demand effect. To understand these values note that
the policies initially increase the income of consumers directly, which leads to a boost in
consumption. As a consequence, this boost triggers an aggregate demand effect which
increases the income of everyone and in turn leads to an additional boost to consumption.
We refer to the sum of this initial and the indirect boost to consumption as the firstround AD effect. However, the AD effect continues as the indirect boost to consumption
triggers another round of income increases which further boost consumption and so
on. One might argue that these higher-order rounds of the AD effect are not likely to
be anticipated by consumers. Since higher-order consumption boosts only materialize
if consumers anticipate them and act accordingly, the overall increase in consumption
might turn out to be smaller than suggested by the full AD effect. As shown in the
middle row of the table, the multipliers are smaller when excluding higher-order rounds.
Nevertheless, the ranking of the policies remains unchanged.

4.3 Welfare
{sec:welfare}

In this section, we look at the welfare implications of each stimulus policy. To do
so, we need a way to aggregate welfare in our model with individual utility functions.
In our model, some households consume much less than other households, and a social
planner with equal weights on each household could significantly increase welfare through
redistribution across households even in normal times. We are interested in the benefit
of carrying out fiscal policies in a recession, so we do not want our results to reflect the
benefits of redistribution inherent in our model in normal times.
Our welfare measure weights the felicity of a household at time t by the inverse of the
marginal utility of the same household in a counterfactual simulation in which neither
the recession occurred nor the fiscal policy was implemented, discounted by the real
interest rate.20 This weighting scheme means that in normal times the marginal benefit
or cost to a social planner of moving a dollar of consumption from one household at one
time period to another household at the same or a different time period is zero. Hence,
20

Discounting at the real interest rate accounts for the fact that a redistributive policy over time will
require borrowing or lending at the real interest rate. The preference discount factors of households
would appear in both the numerator and the denominator—the utility and marginal utility—and
therefore cancel and do not play a role in our welfare measure.

28

in normal times, any re-distributive policy has zero marginal benefit. However, in a
recession when the average marginal utility is higher than in normal times, there can be
welfare benefits to government borrowing to allow households to consume more during
the recession.
Let cit,normal be the consumption—inclusive of the splurge—of household i at time t
in the baseline simulation with no recession and no fiscal policy. The (undiscounted)
marginal utility of an extra unit of consumption for this household in this time period
is u′ (cit,normal ).
Let cit,policy,Rec,AD be the consumption of the same household under the fiscal policy,
policy, possibly a recession, Rec ∈ {0, 1}, and in an economy with or without aggregate
demand effects, AD ∈ {0, 1}.21
We also denote the net present value of the government expenditures of the policy as
N P V (policy, Rec, AD). With this notation, we can now define the welfare bang-for-thebuck of a policy as:
N X
∞
X
1 u(cit,policy,Rec,AD ) − u(cit,none,Rec,AD )
1
,
W(policy, Rec, AD) =
N P V (policy, Rec, AD) i=1 t=0 Rt
u′ (cit,normal )
(9) {welfare_def6}
In normal times, this welfare measure will be exactly equal to one for any small-scale
fiscal expansion. To see this, note that the numerator, u(cit,policy,0,0 ) − u(cit,none,0,0 ), is
equal to the change in consumption multiplied by the marginal utility in normal times.
As the total change in consumption is equal to the net present value of the policy, which
we divide by, the total welfare measure is equal to one. Note that for large increases in
consumption, this measure may be less than one because the utility function is concave.

W(policy, Rec = 0, AD = 0)
W(policy, Rec = 1, AD = 0)

Table 6 Welfare measures, calculated for policies implemented both out of and in a
recession with and without aggregate demand effects
{welfare6}

Table 6 shows the welfare measure for each policy as defined by equation (9). The
top row of the table shows the welfare measure for implementing each policy in normal
times. For marginal policies, this is equal to one by definition. Indeed, the value for
both the stimulus check and the tax cut policy is very close to one. However, the welfare
measure for the extended unemployment policy in normal times is noticeably less than
one. This is because, although this policy is smaller in absolute size than the other

In the simulations, household i experiences the same permanent and transitory shock sequence,
but in the recession simulation some households experience unemployment during periods in which the
same household is employed in the baseline simulation.

29

policies, its consumption effects are concentrated on a small number of households that
remain unemployed long enough to receive the extended benefits. For these households,
the effect on consumption is large enough such that the non linearity of the consumption
function leads to smaller welfare benefit than the marginal utility of consumption would
otherwise imply.
The second row of table 6 shows the welfare benefit of each policy in a recession
without any aggregate demand effects. Again, the stimulus check and tax cut policies
have measures that are close to one—pulling forward consumption has little welfare
benefit for the average household because the average marginal utility of consumption
is only a little higher than in normal times. By contrast, the policy sees benefits of 1.8
dollars for every dollar spent on extended UI benefits during a recession. This is because
many of the households who are unemployed for many quarters in the recession would
have never been unemployed, or quickly reemployed, in normal times and hence their
marginal utility of consumption is much higher in the recession than in normal times.
The third row of the table shows the welfare measure for each policy in a recession
in the version of the model with aggregate demand effects during the recession. The
payroll tax cut now has a noticeable benefit, as some of the tax cut gets spent during
the recession, resulting in higher incomes for all consumers. However, the tax cut is
received over a period of two years, and much of the relief may be after the recession—
and hence the aggregate demand effect—is over. Furthermore, because the payroll tax
cut goes only to employed consumers who have relatively lower MPCs, the spending
out of this stimulus will be further delayed, possibly beyond the period of the recession.
By contrast, the stimulus check is received in the first period of the recession and goes
to both employed and unemployed consumers. The earlier arrival and higher MPCs of
the stimulus check recipients mean more of the stimulus is spent during the recession,
leading to greater aggregate demand effects, higher income, and higher welfare. The
extended UI arrives, on average, slightly later than the stimulus check. However, the
recipients, who have been unemployed for at least six months, spend the extra benefits
relatively quickly, resulting in significant aggregate demand effects during the recession.
In contrast to the payroll tax cut, extended UI has the benefit of automatically reducing
if the recession ends early, making fewer consumers eligible for the benefit.

4.4 Comparing the policies
The results presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3 indicate that the extension of unemployment
benefits is the clear “bang for the buck” winner. The extended UI payments are well
targeted to consumers with high MPCs and high marginal utility, giving rise to large
multipliers and welfare improvements. The stimulus checks come in slightly higher when
measured by their short-term multiplier effect but are a distant second when measured
by their welfare effects. The stimulus checks have large initial multipliers because the
money gets to consumers at the beginning of the recession and therefore induce aggregate
demand effects more quickly. However, the checks are not well targeted to high-MPC
consumers, so even though the funds arrive early in the recession, they are spent out

30

more slowly than the extended unemployment benefits.22 Furthermore, the average
recipient of a stimulus check has a much lower marginal utility than consumers receiving
unemployment benefits, so the welfare benefits of this policy are substantially muted
relative to UI extensions.
The payroll tax cut policy does poorly by both measures: It has a low overall multiplier
and negligible welfare benefits. The reasons are that the funds are slow to arrive, so the
subsequent spending often occurs after the end of the recession, and that the payments
are particularly badly targeted—they go only to employed consumers.
While it is clear from the analysis that the extended unemployment benefits should
be the first tool to use, a disadvantage of them is that they are limited in their size. If a
larger fiscal stimulus is deemed appropriate, then stimulus checks provide an alternative
option that will stimulate spending during the recession even if the welfare benefits are
substantially lower than the UI extension.

4.5 Results in a model without the splurge
We introduce the splurge in our model with the aim of matching empirical evidence on
the dynamics of spending in response to transitory income shocks. The splurge acts as
a stand-in for competing theories for why agents may spend more out of those shocks
than suggested by a simple model in which forward-looking agents solely maximize
utility. However, it is natural to consider to what extent the splurge is in fact necessary
to match the empirical patterns and the implications for our results ranking the different
policies. To assess this we reestimate the model without the splurge and recompute all
our results regarding the relative effectiveness of the policies in this version of the model.
The details of this exercise are in Appendix A. There we discuss how the estimation of
the Norwegian model in section 3.1 is affected if we do not include splurge consumption,
and the estimation of the discount factor distributions for each education group in the
US economy without taking the splurge as given. The general result is that the we can
match the liquid wealth distributions that we target also in models that do not include
a splurge. The models do so by estimating wider distributions of discount factors than
we found in section 3.1 and 3.3.2.
Without the splurge the models do struggle to exactly match the dynamics of spending
after a temporary income shock, however. In particular, for the estimation of the
Norwegian model, we can compare the model’s implications for MPCs for different
wealth quartiles to empirical estimates. Without the splurge, the model leads to an
MPC for the top wealth quartile that is far lower than in the data. In the US model
this MPC is also quite low compared to the model with splurge consumption, but for
the US we do not have an empirical estimate to compare to.
To evaluate the impact of splurge consumption on our ranking of the policies, we
simulate the three fiscal policies in the reestimated model without the splurge. There
22

Theoretically, stimulus checks could be targeted to the highest-MPC households which, for smallsized policies, would mean households with an MPC of one. However, data limitations and other
practicalities make means-testing stimulus checks by income the extent of targeting in practice.

31

are only minor shifts in the multipliers of the policies, but the lower average MPCs
reduces multipliers for the check and tax cut policy relative to the model with the
splurge. In contrast, the UI extension becomes slighlty more effective in stimulating
consumption as the wider distribution of discount factors implies a larger share of the
population that hits the borrowing constraint upon expiry of UI benefits. Hence, the
extension of UI benefits affects agents more strongly in the model without the splurge.
More importantly for the main conclusion of our paper, table 7 compares the welfare
implications of the policies in the two models. Generally, the welfare metric varies only
marginally across the models. When aggregate demand effects are active, we see slightly
larger differences in the welfare evaluation, with the check policy losing ground against
the UI extension. This is because the welfare impact of the check in the model with
the splurge is contingent on the checks being spent quickly due to a high average MPC
and thus generating strong aggregate demand effects while the recession is still ongoing.
In the absence of the splurge only liquidity-constrained agents spend the check money
quickly, such that recession-induced aggregate demand effects are smaller.

{tab:welfare6_Splur

Overall, we can conclude that the ranking of the policies remains unaffected by the
splurge. The splurge is thus helpful in matching available empirical evidence, but does
not affect the assessment of the effectiveness of the considered policies.

5 Robustness in a HANK and SAM Model
{sec:hank}

The main results of this paper are presented in a partial equilibrium setup with aggregate
demand effects that do not arise from general equilibrium effects. We think there are
many advantages to studying the welfare and multiplier effects in this setting without
embedding the model in general equilibrium. First, general equilibrium models often
struggle to adequately capture the feedback mechanisms between consumption and income, particularly the asymmetric nature of these relationships during recessionary versus expansionary periods. Additionally, a complete general equilibrium treatment would
necessitate the analysis of numerous complex channels including investment dynamics,
firm ownership structures and dividend distribution policies, inventory management,
and international trade flows—elements that, while important in their own right, would
potentially obscure the core mechanisms we aim to investigate.

32

Despite the advantages of our partial equilibrium approach, here we complement our
analysis with a general equilibrium HANK and SAM model, as standard as possible,
that is able to capture supply-side effects that are absent from the partial equilibrium
model. In particular, fiscal policies can generate labor market responses that our partial
equilibrium analysis does not address. These supply-side channels can affect both the
welfare implications and the fiscal multipliers of different policy interventions.
We embed the consumption choices of our households—–with heterogeneity over
education type and discount factors—–in a New Keynesian model with search and
matching. Aside from the consumption block of the model, the framework closely
follows Du (2024), with complete details provided in appendix B.23 The general equilibrium structure generates fiscal multipliers through an intertemporal Keynesian cross
mechanism, which becomes particularly pronounced when monetary policy is passive.
Moreover, the search and matching framework allows the employment rate to respond
to policy interventions, allowing us to capture both demand and supply effects of fiscal
policies.
Our approach in this section relies on linearizing the macro dynamics of the model
and employs the Sequence Space Jacobian methods developed by Auclert, Bardóczy,
Rognlie, and Straub (2021). This linearization imposes certain constraints on our
analysis. Notably, we cannot evaluate the effects of different policies starting from
a deep recessionary state, as we do in our main results. This limitation prevents us
from conducting welfare comparisons between recessionary periods and the steady state.
Additionally, the Keynesian cross mechanism embedded in the model exhibits uniform
behavior regardless of the degree of economic slack—–a feature that stands in contrast
to the state-dependent multipliers we apply in our partial equilibrium analysis.24
The consumption response in this general equilibrium model to each of the three
policies is shown in Figure 8. For each of the three fiscal policies, we have shown the
consumption response under three different monetary policy rules: 1) an active Taylor
rule with a coefficient of 1.5 on inflation; 2) a fixed nominal rate (simulating an effective
lower bound); and 3) a fixed real rate (closest in spirit to our partial equilibrium analysis).
Overall, the IRFs from this model are similar to those from the partial equilibrium
analysis, especially under the fixed real-rate rule.25 Furthermore, although we are unable
to repeat our welfare analysis under a recession in this model, the distributional effects of
the policies are similar. Most importantly, the mechanism leading to far greater welfare
benefits for the UI extension, namely that the newly unemployed have high marginal

We note two additional technical limitations of our general equilibrium implementation. First,
stimulus payments in the model are specified as proportional to permanent income, rather than as
means-tested fixed dollar amounts as implemented in practice and in our partial equilibrium framework.
Second, splurge behavior only occurs out of equilibrium.
25
Note that the dynamics of the UI extension IRF are somewhat faster acting. This is because, under
the recession that we study in the partial equilibrium analysis, the large mass of newly-unemployed
households do not start receiving extended UI for six months.

Model

utility, are robust to the supply-side effects of a general equilibrium HANK and SAM
model.
Figure 9 shows the consumption multipliers over different horizons under a fixed real
rate rule, alongside those in our baseline partial equilibrium model. The multipliers are
bigger in the HANK and SAM model. Nevertheless, in both models, the relative ranking
of the consumption multipliers over time horizons are similar, with the effect of the tax
cut substantially smaller than the stimulus check or UI extension policies, despite the
inclusion of supply-side effects in this HANK model. However, towards the end of the
period shown the tax cut consumption multiplier is near that of the stimulus check.
This is because the aggregate demand effects in our partial equilibrium model do not
continue beyond the recession, dampening the benefits of the tax cut policy—in which
much of the extra spending occurs after the recession is over—relative to the stimulus
check and extended UI policies.

6 Conclusion
For many years leading up to the Great Recession, a widely held view among macroeconomists was that countercyclical policy should be left to central banks, because fiscal
policy responses were unpredictable in their timing, their content, and their effects.
Nevertheless, even during this period, fiscal policy responses to recessions were repeatedly tried, perhaps because the macroeconomists’ advice to policymakers, “don’t just do
something; stand there”—is not politically tenable.
This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic modeling has finally advanced to the
point where we can make reasonably credible assessments of the effects of alternative
policies of the kinds that have been tried. The key developments have been both the
advent of national registry datasets that can measure crucial microeconomic phenomena
and the creation of tools of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic modeling that can match
those micro facts and glean their macroeconomic implications.
We examine three fiscal policy experiments that have actually been implemented in
the past: an extension of UI benefits, a stimulus check, and a tax cut on labor income.

Figure 9 Consumption Multipliers over Different Horizons in the HANK Model

Our model suggests that the extension of UI benefits is a clear “bang for the buck”
winner. While the stimulus check arrives faster and generates multiplier effects more
quickly, it is less well targeted to high-MPC households than an extension of UI benefits.
By contrast, the welfare gains of extended UI benefits are significantly greater than those
of a stimulus check. The chief drawback of the UI extension is that its size is limited
by the fact that a relatively small share of the population is affected by it. In contrast,
stimulus checks are easily scalable while exhibiting only slightly less recession-period
stimulus (in a typical recession). However, since some of the stimulus checks flow to
well-off consumers, such checks do worse than UI extensions when we evaluate welfare
consequences. Finally, the payroll tax cut is the least effective in terms of both the
multiplier and welfare effect, since it targets only employed consumers and, for a typical
recession, more of its payouts are likely to occur after the recessionary period (when
multipliers may exist) has ended.
The tools we are using could be reasonably easily modified to evaluate a number of
other policies. For example, in the COVID-driven recession, not only was the duration of
UI benefits extended, but those benefits were also supplemented by substantial payments
to all UI recipients. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but
the framework could accommodate such an analysis.

A Results in a model without the splurge

{app:Model_withou

In this appendix, we consider the implications for our results of removing splurge
consumption from the model. First, we discuss that model’s ability to match the
empirical targets that we used to estimate the splurge in section 3.1. Second, we repeat
the estimation of discount factor distributions in the US model in section 3.3.2, and
discuss the implications for both targeted and untargeted moments. Finally, we use the
reestimated model to asses the relevance of the splurge for the effectiveness of the three
policies.

A.1 Matching the IMPCs without the splurge
For the purpose of evaluating the results in the model without the splurge we do not
require the reestimation of our Norwegian model, as the purpose of the latter is the
estimation of the splurge. Nevertheless, we test how well the model can match the
dynamics of spending after a temporary income shock as reported by Fagereng, Holm,
and Natvik (2021) when the splurge is zero. Figure 10 illustrates the fit without the
splurge and compares it to our baseline estimation.

While the splurge helps in matching the empirical evidence on the IMPC, the model
without the splurge also performs relatively well. This is because the model without
the splurge is able to generate a high initial marginal propensity to consume through a
wider distribution of discount factors (β = 0.921 and ∇ = 0.116) relative to the model

with a splurge (β = 0.968 and ∇ = 0.0578). This ensures that sufficiently many agents
are at the borrowing constraint and thus sensitive to transitory income shocks.
However, the model is not quite able to match the difference in spending between
the initial year of the lottery win and the year after. The model without the splurge
exhibits a higher spending propensity in the year after the shock occurs as borrowingconstrained agents spend the additional income quicker. The model without the splurge
also provides a worse fit of the distribution of liquid wealth. Relative to the baseline
model, and to the data, the model without a splurge generates a more unequal wealth
distribution.
The reason for these two effects, becomes apparent when considering the crosssectional implications of the models with and without the splurge across different
wealth quartiles. While the model with the splurge can account for the empiricallyobserved initial MPCs among the wealthiest, the model without the splurge exhibits
much lower MPCs among that group, see Table 8. The wealthiest group will thus
be very patient and have low MPCs, which can explain why the wealth distribution
becomes more unequal and doesnquite

fit the targeted distribution in the data in the
version of the model without the splurge.
Overall, the model fit with the data deteriorates roughly by a factor of two measured
by the Euclidean norm of the targeting error.26

A.2 Estimating discount factor distributions without the splurge
Figure 11 shows that the model without splurge consumption can also match the wealth
distributions in the three education groups very well. We therefore turn to the implications of this version of the model for the untargeted moments discussed in section 3.3.3.
The main difference between the models with and without splurge consumption is
that without splurge consumption the MPCs drop for each education group and wealth
quartile. The difference is largest for the College group and for the highest wealth
quartile (obviously with substantial overlap between these two groups). This is shown
26

Specifically, the Euclidean norm of the targeting error increases from 0.04 to 0.08 for the timeprofile of the marginal propensity to consume when the splurge is removed, from 0.16 to 0.29 for the
marginal propensity to consume across wealth quartiles and from 0.027 to 0.032 for the Lorentz curve.

Figure 11 Distributions of liquid wealth within each educational group and for the
whole population from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances and from
the estimated model withiout splurge consumption

in the two panels in Table 9. The rest of the table shows that the distribution of wealth
is not substantially different in the model estimated without splurge consumption.
Finally, we again consider the implications of our model for the dynamics of spending
over time and for the dynamics of spending for households that remain unemployed long
enough for unemployment benefits to expire. Figure 12 repeats Figure 3 with results
from the model without splurge consumption added. The implication is that the model
without a splurge leads to a slightly too low MPC in the year of a lottery win and a
slightly higher MPC in the year after.
The drop in spending when unemployment benefits expire is virtually the same in
the model without splurge consumption (17 percent versus 18 percent in the baseline).
While the consumption dynamics across the models with and without a splurge are fairly
similar, the underlying drivers of the consumption drop upon expiry of unemployment
benefits are different. In the model with the splurge, the drop in income translates
directly into lower consumption via the splurge itself. In the model without the splurge
it is the sharp rise in agents hitting the borrowing constraint which accounts for the
consumption drop after UI benefits expire. This is shown in the solid and dashed red
lines in Figure 12b, and is due to the wider distribution of discount factors that is

A.3 Multipliers in the absence of the splurge
In this section we simulate the three fiscal policies from the main text in the estimated
model without the splurge. The shape of the impulse response functions only marginally
change relative to the model with the splurge. Hence, we focus on the quantitative
changes as summarized by the cummulative multipliers in Figure 13. The figure shows
the multipliers when AD effects are switched on for the model with and without the
splurge. Table 10 shows the 10y-horizon multiplier across the two models.
The absence of the splurge entails a calibration with a lower average MPC in the
population. Hence, the check and tax cut exhibit lower multipliers when there is no
splurge. For the UI extension we observe the opposite pattern, as the multiplier is larger
in the model without the splurge. This due to the consumption dynamics around the
expiry of UI benefits described in the previous section. In the model without the splurge
more agents hit the borrowing constraint upon the expiry of benefits. Providing those
agents with an extension of UI benefits thus turns out to be slightly more powerful.
The policy ranking in terms of the multiplier shifts slighlty. In the model with the
splurge, the check policy delivers multiplier effects much more rapidly than the UI
extension. In the model without splurge consumption, the UI extension appears superior
to the check, both at shorter and longer horizons. Both models agree on the tax cut
being the least effective policy.

B Details of the HANK and SAM Model

{sec:hank_appendix

B.1 Households
The household block follows closely to the main text with a few exceptions. First,
the splurge only occurs out of equilibrium—that is, the steady state of the model is
calculated without the splurge behavior. Second, the level of permanent income of all
newborns is equal to one. Furthermore, all households face the same employment to
unemployment and unemployment to employment probabilities. The probabilities are
calibrated to the transition probabilities of high school graduates from the main text.
Lastly, following the notation of Auclert, Rognlie, and Straub (2020), rta will denote the
economy wide ex-ante real interest rate.

B.2 Goods Market
There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive intermediate goods producers
indexed by j ∈ [0, 1] who produce intermediate goods Yjt to be sold to a final goods
producer at price Pjt . We assume intermediate goods producers consume all profits each
period.
B.2.1 Final Goods Producer
A perfectly competitive final goods producer purchases intermediate goods Yjt for j ∈
[0, 1], from intermediate goods producers at price Pjt and produces a final good Yt
according to a CES production function given by

B.2.2 Intermediate Goods Producers
Intermediate goods producers produce according to a production function linear in
labor Lt :
Yjt = ZLjt ,
where Z is total factor productivity.
Each intermediate goods producer hires labor Lt from a labor agency at cost ht . Given
the cost of labor, each intermediate goods producer chooses Pjt to maximize its profits
facing price stickiness a la Rotemberg (1982). HANK models with sticky prices produce
countercyclical profits which combined with households with high MPCs can lead to
countercyclical consumption responses out of dividends. Therefore, we simply assume
that intermediate goods producers consume all profits rather than distributing them
to households. We therefore abstract from consumption behavior in response to firm
profits. Intermediate goods producers maximize profits by solving:

B.3 Labor market
A risk neutral labor agency sells labor Nt to intermediate goods producers at cost ht by
hiring households at the wage wt . To hire households, the labor agency posts vacancies vt
that are filled with probability ϕt . Household’s search is random. Following Bardoczy
(2024), we assume the labor agency cannot observe the labor productivity of individual households. Instead, the agency can only observe the average productivity of all
employed workers which is always equal to one.

Labor agency. The labor agency determines how many vacancies to post and how

Matching. Matching between households and the labor agency follows a CobbDouglas matching function:
mt = χeαt vt1−α ,
where mt is the mass of matches, et is the mass of job searchers, α is the matching
function elasticity, and χ is a matching efficiency parameter.
The vacancy filling probability ϕt and the job finding probabilities ηt evolve according
to:
ηt = χΘit1−α
ϕt = χΘ−α

where Θt = vett is labor market tightness.
Wage Determination. Similar to Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2021) and

The bond price satisfies the no arbitrage condition:

(2020) and let the tax rate adjusts to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio:

For the tax cuts, we assume:

where ϕG governs the speed of adjustment of government spending in response to debt.

B.5 Monetary Policy
The central bank follows a simple Taylor rule where it only responds to inflation:
it = r∗ + ϕπ πt ,
where ϕπ is the coefficient on inflation. Inflation is given by πt = Pt /Pt−1 − 1, and r∗ is
the steady state interest rate.

0.65 following Ravn and Sterk (2017). The job separation rate is set to 0.092. As in
section 3.3.1, we set the job finding probability in the steady state for the unemployed
ηss to 0.67. Along with the job separation rate, this gives a probability of transitioning
from employment to unemployment within a quarter of 3.1 percent which is the value
we use for the Highschool group in section 3.3.1. The quarterly vacancy filling rate is
0.71 as in den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000) (and together with our other choices,
this pins down the matching efficiency χ). The degree of wage rigidity ϕw is set to 0.837
following Gornemann, Kuester, and Nakajima (2021). The tax rate is set to 0.3 and
government spending is set to clear the government budget constraint. The parameters
that dictate the speed of fiscal adjustment, ϕB and ϕG , are set to 0.015, the lower bound
of the estimates in Auclert, Rognlie, and Straub (2020).29 Furthermore, the decay rate
of government coupons is set to δ = 0.95 to match a maturity of 5 years.30 Finally, the
Taylor rule coefficient on inflation is set to the standard value of ϕπ = 1.5.

The range of plausible values lie between 4% and 14% Silva and Toledo (2009)
The speed of adjustment parameter is set to the lower bound to ensure that the policies evaluated
in the HANK and SAM model are almost entirely deficit financed.
