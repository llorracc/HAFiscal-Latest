<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="abstract"></a> Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics over
four years following an income shock (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)), we assess
the eﬀectiveness of three ﬁscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions.
Unemployment insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck” winner when
eﬀectiveness is measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are second best and have two
advantages (over UI): they arrive faster, and they are scalable to any desired size. A
temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less eﬀective than
the other policies and has negligible eﬀects in the version of our model without a
multiplier.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Fiscal policies that aim to boost consumer spending in recessions have been tried in many
countries in recent decades. The nature of such policies has varied widely, perhaps because
traditional macroeconomic models have not provided plausible guidance about which ones are
likely to be most eﬀective—either in reducing misery (a ‘welfare metric’) or in increasing
output (a ‘GDP metric’).
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  But a new generation of macro models has shown that when microeconomic heterogeneity
across consumer circumstances (wealth; income; education) is taken into account, the
consequences of an income shock for consumer spending depend on a measurable object: the
intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (iMPC) introduced in <a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">Auclert, Rognlie, and
Straub</a> (<a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">2018</a>). The iMPC extends the notion of a marginal propensity to consume
to account for the speed at which households spend. Fortuitously, new sources of
microeconomic data, particularly from Scandinavian national registries, have recently
allowed the ﬁrst high-quality measurements of the iMPC (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Even in models that can match a given measured iMPC pattern, the relative merits of
alternative policies depend profoundly both on the metric (welfare or GDP) and on the
quantitative structure of the rest of the model – for example, whether multipliers exist and
whether the degree of multiplication is diﬀerent under diﬀerent economic conditions. Here,
after constructing a microeconomically credible heterogeneous agent (HA) model, we
examine that model’s implications for how eﬀects of stimulus policies depend on
the existence and timing of any “multipliers,” which, following <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman,
and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>), we model in a clean and simple way, so that the interaction of
the multiplier (if any) with the other elements of the model is reasonably easy to
understand. This partial equilibrium analysis allows us to transparently incorporate the
possibility that multipliers may be larger in recessions. But we understand that a
richer general equilibrium framework could introduce transmission channels absent
from the partial-equilibrium-plus-multiplier analysis, so we also analyze a standard
HANK-and-SAM general equilibrium model modiﬁed to embed our households’ consumption
responses.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>  
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="microeconomically-credible"></a> By “microeconomically credible,” we mean, at a minimum, a model that can
match both the cross-sectional distribution of liquid wealth (following <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and
Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>)’s deﬁnition of liquid wealth) and the entire pattern of the iMPC from
<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>) (see Figure <a 
href="#x1-18003r1">1a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:aggmpclotterywin --></a> for their data and our model’s ﬁt to
it).
<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="excess-initial-mpc"></a> Standard HA models can match both the pattern of spending in years
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
1-4 (for a shock that arrives in year 0) and the initial distribution of liquid
wealth.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1003f2"></a>  
But even a brief look at the ﬁgure convinces the eye that spending in the initial period when
the shock arrives seems out of line with the smooth declining pattern in years 1-4. The eye is
not wrong: HA models that match liquid assets and the spending pattern in years 1-4 seriously
underpredict the amount of immediate spending that occurs on receipt of the income
shock.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  We call this initial extra spending the ‘excess initial MPC.’ Below, we describe a substantial
and longstanding literature in which the pattern of an excess initial MPC has been
documented, and a vigorous recent literature conﬁrming the fact with diﬀerent datasets and
proposing various potential theoretical explanations.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >  If multipliers are operative only in recessions (or are more powerful in recessions), a model
that fails to capture the excess initial MPC might generate the wrong answers for the
eﬀectiveness of the alternative ﬁscal policies.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  The purpose of our paper is not to weigh in on which of the alternative models of an excess
initial MPC is right. Instead we sought the simplest modeling device that would capture the
empirical fact of an excess initial MPC and permit unambiguous welfare calculations.
We accomplish this by adding to the standard model something we call “splurge”
beahavior, in which each household has a portion of income out of which they have a
high MPC, and the remainder of their income is disposed of as in standard micro
models with mildly impatient but time-consistent consumers. Because the available
evidence ﬁnds high initial MPCs even among wealthy households, we assume that this
splurge behavior is the same across households and independent of their liquid wealth
holdings.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1005f3"></a>  
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  Our resulting structural model could be used to evaluate a wide variety of consumption
stimulus policies. We examine three that have been implemented in recent recessions in the
United States (and elsewhere): an extension of unemployment insurance (UI) beneﬁts, a
means-tested stimulus check, and a payroll tax cut.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  Our ﬁrst metric of policy eﬀectiveness is “spending bang for the buck”: For a dollar of
spending on a particular policy, how much multiplication is induced? First, we calculate the
policy-induced spending dynamics in an economy with no multiplier. We then follow <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger,
Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>)’s approach to modeling the aggregate demand externality, in which
output depends mechanically on the level of consumption relative to steady state. But in our
model, the aggregate demand externality is only switched on when the economy is
experiencing a recession—there is no multiplication for spending that occurs after our
simulated recession is over.
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >  Even without multiplication, a utility-based metric can justify countercyclical policy on
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
welfare grounds because the larger idiosyncratic shocks to income that occur during a
recession may justify a greater-than-normal degree of social insurance. Because our model’s
outcomes reﬂect the behavior of utility-maximizing consumers, we can calculate a measure of
the eﬀectiveness of alternative policies: their eﬀect on consumers’ welfare. We call this “welfare
bang for the buck.”
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >  The principal diﬀerence between the two metrics is that what matters for the degree of
spending multiplication is how much of the policy-induced extra spending occurs during the
recession (when the multiplier matters), while eﬀectiveness in the utility metric also depends
on who is doing the extra spending (because the recession hits some households much harder
than others).
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  Because high-MPC consumers tend to have high marginal utility, a standard aggregated
welfare function would favor redistribution to such consumers even in the absence of a
recession. We are interested in the degree of <span 
class="ec-lmri-12">extra </span>motivation for social insurance that
is present in a recession, so we construct our social welfare metric speciﬁcally to
measure only the <span 
class="ec-lmri-12">incremental </span>social welfare eﬀect of alternative policies during
recessions (beyond whatever redistributional logic might apply during expansions – see
section <a 
href="#x1-310004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a>).
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  When the multiplier is active, any reduction in aggregate consumption below its
steady-state level directly reduces aggregate productivity and thus labor income. Hence, any
policy stimulating consumption will also boost incomes through this aggregate demand
multiplier channel.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  Our results are intuitive. In the economy with no recession multiplier, the beneﬁt of a sustained payroll
tax cut is negligible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal5.html#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1007f4"></a>  
When a multiplier exists, the tax cut has more beneﬁts, especially if the recession continues
long enough that most of the spending induced by the tax cut happens while the economy is
still in recession (and the multiplier still is in force). The typical recession, however, ends long
before our ‘sustained’ wage tax cut is reversed—and even longer before lower-MPC consumers
have spent down most of their extra after-tax income. Accordingly, even in an economy with a
multiplier that is powerful during recessions, much of the wage tax cut’s eﬀect on
consumption occurs when any multiplier that might have existed in a recession is no longer
operative.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >  Even leaving aside any multiplier eﬀects, the stimulus checks improve welfare more than the
wage tax cut, because at least a portion of such checks go to unemployed people who have
both high MPCs and high marginal utilities (while wage tax cuts, by deﬁnition, go only to
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
persons who are employed and earning wages). The greatest “welfare bang for the
buck” comes from the UI insurance extension, because many of the recipients are in
circumstances in which they have a much higher marginal utility than they would have had
in the absence of the recession, whether or not the aggregate demand externality
exists.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >  And, in contrast to the wage-tax cut, both the UI extension and the stimulus
checks concentrate most of the marginal increment to consumption at times when the
multiplier (if it exists) is still powerful. A disadvantage of the UI extension relative
to the stimulus checks, in terms of “spending bang for the buck,” is that it takes
somewhat more time until the transfers reach the beneﬁciaries. The stimulus checks are
assumed to be distributed immediately in the same quarter as the recession starts.
Countering this disadvantage is the fact that the MPC of UI recipients is higher
than that of stimulus check recipients, and, furthermore, the insurance nature of
the UI payments reduces the precautionary saving motive. In the end, our model
says that these two forces roughly balance each other, so that the spending bang
for the buck of the two policies is similar. In the welfare metric, however, there is
considerable marginal value to UI recipients even if they receive some of the beneﬁts after
the recession is over (and no multiplier exists). Hence, in the welfare metric, the
relative value of UI beneﬁts is increased compared with the policy of sending stimulus
checks.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >  We conclude that extended UI beneﬁts should be the ﬁrst weapon employed from this
arsenal, as they have a greater welfare beneﬁt than stimulus checks and a similar (multiplied)
spending eﬀect. But a disadvantage is that the total amount of stimulus that can be
accomplished with the UI extension is constrained by the fact that only a limited
number of people become unemployed. If more stimulation is called for than can be
accomplished via the UI extension, checks have the advantage that their eﬀects
scale almost linearly in the size of the stimulus—see <a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">Beraja and Zorzi</a> (<a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">2023</a>) for a
more detailed exposition of the relation between MPC and stimulus size. The wage
tax cut is also, in principle, scalable, but its eﬀects are smaller because recipients
have lower MPCs and marginal utility than check and UI recipients. In the real
world, a tax cut is also likely the least ﬂexible of the three tools: UI beneﬁts can be
further extended, and multiple rounds of checks can be sent, but multiple rounds of
changes in payroll tax rates would likely be administratively and politically more
diﬃcult.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >  One theme of our paper is that which policies are better or worse, and by how much,
depends on both the quantitative details of the policies and the quantitative modeling of the
economy.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  But the tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of
other policies. For example, in the COVID-19 recession in the US, not only was the
duration of UI beneﬁts extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by
substantial extra payments to every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model
to match this particular policy, but the framework could accommodate such an
analysis.

high MPC’s even by wealthy households with ample liquidity casts doubt on this

monetary policy was essentially ﬁxed at the zero lower bound (ZLB). We therefore do
not consider monetary policy responses to the policies we evaluate in our primary
analysis, and our work thus relates to papers such as <a

<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >  One part of these decompositions is tricky: Under standard calibrations like the ones we use,

propensity to consume) back to consumption, amplifying the eﬀect of a recession when it

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >We model the arrival of a recession, and the government policy response to it, as an
unpredictable event—an MIT shock. We have four types of shocks: one representing a
recession and one for each of the three diﬀerent policy responses we consider. The policy
responses are usually modeled as in addition to the recession, but we also consider a
counterfactual in which the policy response occurs without a recession in order to understand
the welfare eﬀects of the policy.

 id="x1-10000"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-12">Recession.</span></span>
  At the onset of a recession, several changes occur. First, the unemployment rate for each
education group doubles: Those who would have been unemployed in the absence of a
recession are still unemployed, and an additional number of consumers move from employment
to unemployment. Second, conditional on the recession continuing, the employment transition
matrix is adjusted so that unemployment remains at the new high level and the expected
length of time for an unemployment spell increases. In our baseline calibration, discussed in
detail in section <a 
href="#x1-210003.3.1">3.3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:calib --></a>, we set the expected length of an unemployment spell to one
and a half quarters in normal times, and this length increases to four quarters in a
recession. Third, the end of the recession occurs as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an
average length of recession of six quarters. Finally, at the end of a recession, the
employment transition matrix switches back to its original probabilities, and, as a
result, the unemployment rate trends down over time, back to its steady-state level.
The details of how certain model parameters change in a recession are presented in
section <a

  The policies we consider in response to a recession are inspired by the Economic Stimulus
Act of 2008 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation
Act of 2010. The former included means tested stimulus checks in the form of tax rebates,
and the latter included both an extension of unemployment beneﬁts and a tax cut.
Based on these examples we therefore consider the following stimulus policies in our
framework:

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-12">1. Stimulus check.</span></span>
  In this policy response, the government sends money to every consumer that directly
increases the household’s market resources. The checks are means-tested depending on
permanent income. A check for $1,200 is sent to every household with permanent income less
than $100,000, and this amount is then linearly reduced to zero for households with a
permanent income greater than $150,000. Similar policies were implemented in the U.S. in
2001, 2008, and during the pandemic.

 id="x1-13000"></a><span 
class="ec-lmbx-12">2. Extended unemployment beneﬁts.</span></span>
  In this policy response, unemployment beneﬁts are extended from two quarters to four
quarters. That is, those who become unemployed at the start of the recession, or who were
already unemployed, will receive unemployment beneﬁts for up to four quarters (including
quarters leading up to the recession). Those who become unemployed one quarter into the
recession will receive up to three quarters of unemployment beneﬁts. These extended
unemployment beneﬁts will occur regardless of whether the recession ends, and
no further extensions are granted if the recession continues. This policy reﬂects
temporary changes made to unemployment beneﬁts in the U.S. following the great
recession.

During this period, which continues irrespective of whether the recession continues or ends,
employed consumers’ income is increased by 2 percent. The income of the unemployed is
unchanged by this policy. Households also believe there is a 50-50 chance that the tax cut will
be extended by another two years if the recession has not ended when the ﬁrst tax cut

  Some work in the HA macro literature has shown that if taxes are raised immediately to
oﬀset any ﬁscal stimulus, results can be very diﬀerent than they would be if, as occurs in
reality, recessionary policies are debt ﬁnanced. However, typical ﬁscal rules assume that any
increase in debt gets ﬁnanced over a long interval. Accordingly, almost all of the eﬀects of any
particular ﬁscal rule will be similar for each of our policies so long as the great
majority of the debt is repaid after the short recessionary period that is our main
focus.
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >  To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we do not model the debt repayment. Any of a
variety of ﬁscal rules could be imposed for the period following our short period of interest, but we
did not want to choose any particular ﬁscal rule in order to avoid making a choice that has
little consequence for our key question. Advocates of alternative ﬁscal rules likely already have
intuitions about how such rules’ economic consequences diﬀer, but those consequences—under
our partial equilibrium analysis—will be similar for all three policies we consider. Alternative
choices of ﬁscal rules will therefore not aﬀect the ranking of policies that is our principal
concern.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >Our baseline model is a partial equilibrium model that does not include any feedback from
aggregate consumption to income. In an extension to the model, we add aggregate demand
eﬀects during the recession. The motivation for this speciﬁcation comes from the idea that
spending in an economy with substantial slack and in which the central bank is unable to
prevent a recession will result in higher utilization rates and greater output. By
contrast, government spending in an economy running at potential with an active
monetary policy will not succeed in increasing output. The recent inﬂation experience
of the U.S. provides some evidence that output responds highly non-linearly to
aggregate demand. This idea is explored in a recent revival of research into non-linear
Phillips curves, such as <a

calibrated equally for all types, and some parameters are calibrated to be speciﬁc to each
education group. Finally, a distribution of subjective discount factors is estimated
separately for each education group to match features of each within-group liquid wealth
distribution.

<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >The splurge allows us to capture the shorter- and longer-term response of consumption to
income shocks, especially for consumers with signiﬁcant liquid wealth. The main aim of this
paper, however, is to rank consumption stimulus policies, not to provide a microfoundation for
the splurging behavior. We view the splurge factor as a model device that enables us to rank
the policies in a model that is consistent with the best available micro-evidence of spending
patterns over time after a transitory income shock. In appendix <a 
href="#x1-37000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:Model_without_splurge --></a> we provide results from our
model without a splurge factor. There we show that such a model provides a worse ﬁt to the
moments in the data that we are interested in, but not dramatically so, and that our
conclusions regarding the ranking of the policies are not aﬀected. However, in our
view, this version of the model requires households with unreasonably low discount
factors.

We calibrate our model to reﬂect the Norwegian economy and, using their results, estimate the
splurge factor, as well as the distribution of discount factors in the population, to match two
empirical moments.

out of a one-period income shock. We target not only the initial (aggregate) response of
consumption to the income shock, but also the subsequent eﬀect on consumption in years one
through four after the shock. We also target the initial consumption response in the
cross-section, i.e. across the quartiles of the liquid wealth distribution, for which empirical

the head is of working age, which we deﬁne to be in the range from 25 to 62. The SCF-variable
“normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent income, and, to exclude
outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5 percent of the distribution of
this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for households in our sample is thus

market, checking, savings, and call accounts; directly held mutual funds; and stocks and

we also report implications of the model for some non-targeted moments. Panel A of
table <a 
href="#x1-24001r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:nonTargetedMoments --></a> shows the wealth distribution across the three education groups in the data
and in the model. The model matches these shares quite closely, which may not be
surprising given that we calibrate the size of each group and we manage to ﬁt the wealth
distribution within each group separately. The panel also reports the average marginal
propensity to consume for the diﬀerent groups. To be comparable to numbers reported
in <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), these are calculated as the average MPC
in the year of a lottery win. Lottery wins occur in a random quarter of the year
that diﬀers across individuals. The MPC for an individual depends on the spending
pattern after the win, and these are averaged across individuals within each education
group.
<!--l. 429--><p class="indent" >  Panel B of table <a 
href="#x1-24001r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:nonTargetedMoments --></a> shows similar numbers to Panel A, sorted by quartiles of the liquid
wealth distribution instead of education groups. Our model yields a slightly more concentrated
liquid wealth distribution than in the data. However, it does produce a fairly high MPC even
for households in the highest quartile of the liquid wealth distribution. This is consistent with
the results found in the Norwegian data by <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), but also with
recent results in <a 
href="#Xgraham2024mental">Graham and McDowall</a> (<a 
href="#Xgraham2024mental">2024</a>). In an administrative dataset from a large US
ﬁnancial institution, they ﬁnd that the spending response to an income receipt is large
across the distribution of liquid asset holdings. In our model, we obtain this result
due to the inclusion of the splurge factor. As shown in Appendix <a 
href="#x1-37000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:Model_without_splurge --></a>, the model is

<!--l. 470--><p class="indent" >  Finally, we consider the implications of our model for two diﬀerent patterns of
spending over time. The ﬁrst pattern is the dynamics of spending after a lottery win
from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a>. This pattern was used in the estimation of the
splurge factor in section <a 
href="#x1-180003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a>, but was not targeted when estimating the discount
factor distributions for each education group in section <a

href="#x1-24002r1">2a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:USaggmpclotterywin --></a> shows that
the model that is estimated taking the value of the splurge as given, results in a
distribution of spending over time that is very similar to the one found in the Norwegian
data.
<!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >  <a

<!--l. 477--><p class="indent" >  The second pattern concerns the dynamics of income and spending for households that
become unemployed and remain unemployed long enough for unemployment beneﬁts to
expire. Figure <a

and Noel</a> (<a

percent the month when beneﬁts expire. Our quarterly model is broadly consistent
with this as the drop in spending the quarter after the expiry of UI beneﬁts is 18
percent.

stimulus in our calibrated model. The policies we compare are a means-tested stimulus check,
an extension of unemployment beneﬁts, and a payroll tax cut. Each policy is implemented at
the start of a recession, and we compare results both with and without aggregate demand
eﬀects being active during the recession. First, we present impulse responses of aggregate
income and consumption after the implementation of each policy. Then we compare the
policies in terms of their cumulative multipliers and in terms of their eﬀect on a welfare
measure that we introduce. Finally, based on these comparisons, we can rank the three
policies.

href="#x1-27001r1">3a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessioncheckrelrecession --></a> shows the impulse response of income and consumption when stimulus checks are
issued in the ﬁrst quarter of a recession. In the model without a multiplier, the stimulus checks
account for 5 percent of the ﬁrst quarter’s income. In the following quarters, there are no
further stimulus payments, and income remains the same as it would have been without the
stimulus check policy. Consumption is about 2.5 percent higher in the ﬁrst quarter, which
includes the splurge response to the stimulus check. Consumption then drops to less than 1
percent above the counterfactual, and the remainder of the stimulus check money is then
spent over the next few years. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income in
the ﬁrst quarter is 6 percent higher than the counterfactual, as the extra spending
feeds into higher incomes. Consumption in this model jumps to a higher level than
without aggregate demand eﬀects and comes down more slowly as the feedback eﬀects
from consumption to income dampen the speed with which income—and hence the
splurge—return to zero. After a couple of years, when the recession is most likely over and
aggregate demand eﬀects are no longer in place, income is close to where it would
be without the stimulus check policy, although consumption remains somewhat

<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >The impulse responses in Figure <a 
href="#x1-27002r2">3b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessionuirelrecession --></a> show the response to a policy that extends unemployment
beneﬁts from 6 months to 12 months for a period of a year. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, the path for income now depends on the number of consumers who receive
the extended unemployment beneﬁts. These consumers are those who have been
unemployed for between 6 and 12 months. In the ﬁrst quarter of the recession, the newly
unemployed receive unemployment beneﬁts regardless of whether they are extended or not.
Therefore, it is in the second and third quarters, when the eﬀects of the recession on
long-term unemployment start to materialize, that the extended UI payments ramp up,
amounting to an aggregate increase in quarterly income by 0.7 percent. By the ﬁfth
quarter, the policy is no longer in eﬀect, and income from extended unemployment
goes to zero. Consumption in the ﬁrst quarter jumps by more than income (by 0.3
percent), prompted by both the increase in expected income and the reduced need for
precautionary saving given the extended insurance. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, consumption is only a little above the counterfactual by the time
the policy is over. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, there is an extra
boost to income of about the same size in the ﬁrst and second quarters. As this
extra aggregate demand induced income goes to employed consumers, more of it is
saved, and consumption remains elevated several quarters beyond the end of the
policy.

href="#x1-27003r3">3c<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessiontaxcutrelrecession --></a>, shows the impulse response for a payroll tax cut
that persists for two years (eight quarters). In the model without aggregate demand eﬀects,
income rises by close to 2 percent as the take-home pay for employed consumers goes up. After
the two-year period, income drops back to where it would have been without the payroll
tax cut. Consumption jumps close to 1 percent in response to the tax cut. Over
the period in which the tax cut is in eﬀect, consumption rises somewhat as the
stock of precautionary savings goes up. Following the drop in income, consumption
drops sharply because of the splurge and then decreases over time as consumers
spend out the savings they built up over the period the tax cut was in eﬀect. In the
model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income rises by about 2.3 percent above the
counterfactual and then declines steadily as the probability that the recession remains
active—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀects in place—goes down over time.
Following the end of the policy, the savings stock in the model with aggregate demand
eﬀects is high, and consumption remains signiﬁcantly elevated through the period
shown.

href="#x1-30004r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> shows the 10y-horizon multiplier for each policy. The stimulus check, which is paid out in
quarter one, exhibits the largest multiplier on impact. About 50 percent of the total policy
expenditure is immediately spent by consumers. After two years, and because of the aggregate
demand eﬀects, consumption has increased cumulatively by more than the cost of the stimulus
check. Over time, the policy reaches a total multiplier of 1.199. Without AD eﬀects the
policy only generates a multiplier of 0.854. The last two rows in table <a 
href="#x1-30004r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> show the
expected share of the policy expenditures and stimulated consumption that occurs
during a recession. For the stimulus check all of the policy expenditures occur in the
ﬁrst quarter and thus with certainty during the recession. However, since induced
consumption also takes place during later periods at which time the recession may have
already ended, the share of stimulated consumption during the recession is lower at
75%.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >  Since spending for the UI policy is spread out over four quarters (and peaks in quarters two
to three), the multiplier in the ﬁrst quarter is considerably lower than in the case of the
stimulus check. However, the UI extension policy is targeted in the sense that it provides
additional income only to those consumers who have large MPCs, because of unemployment.
Also, over the medium-term UI extension expenditures are more likely to induce consumption
spending during the recession compared to the check stimulus, see the last row
in table <a 
href="#x1-30004r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a>. This is because UI extension expenditures aﬀect agents who spend the
additional income relatively quickly once it reaches them. Therefore, the cumulative
mulitiplier of the UI extension exceeds that of the stimulus check after about one
year.

<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut has the lowest multiplier irrespective of the considered horizon. A
multiplier of close to 1 is reached only after 10 years with AD eﬀects. These relatively small
numbers reﬂect that policy spending lasts for a long time and is thus more likely to occur after
the recession has ended. Moreover, only employed consumers, often with relatively low MPCs,
beneﬁt directly from the payroll tax cut. Therefore, the policy is poorly targeted if the goal is
to provide short-term stimulus.
<!--l. 165--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-30004r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> contains an additional (middle) row with results for an economy where we only
consider a “ﬁrst-round” aggregate demand eﬀect. To understand these values note that the
policies initially increase the income of consumers directly, which leads to a boost in
consumption. As a consequence, this boost triggers an aggregate demand eﬀect
which increases the income of everyone and in turn leads to an additional boost to
consumption. We refer to the sum of this initial and the indirect boost to consumption as
the ﬁrst-round AD eﬀect. However, the AD eﬀect continues as the indirect boost
to consumption triggers another round of income increases which further boost
consumption and so on. One might argue that these higher-order rounds of the AD
eﬀect are not likely to be anticipated by consumers. Since higher-order consumption
boosts only materialize if consumers anticipate them and act accordingly, the overall
increase in consumption might turn out to be smaller than suggested by the full AD
eﬀect. As shown in the middle row of the table, the multipliers are smaller when
excluding higher-order rounds. Nevertheless, the ranking of the policies remains
unchanged.

<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we look at the welfare implications of each stimulus policy. To do so, we need a
way to aggregate welfare in our model with individual utility functions. In our model, some
households consume much less than other households, and a social planner with equal weights
on each household could signiﬁcantly increase welfare through redistribution across households
even in normal times. We are interested in the beneﬁt of carrying out ﬁscal policies in a
recession, so we do not want our results to reﬂect the beneﬁts of redistribution inherent in our
model in normal times.
<!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >  Our welfare measure weights the felicity of a household at time <span 
class="lmmi-12">t </span>by the inverse of the
marginal utility of the same household in a counterfactual simulation in which neither the
recession occurred nor the ﬁscal policy was implemented, discounted by the real interest
rate.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal28.html#fn27x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">27</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-31001f27"></a>  
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
This weighting scheme means that in normal times the marginal beneﬁt or cost to a social
planner of moving a dollar of consumption from one household at one time period to another
household at the same or a diﬀerent time period is zero. Hence, in normal times,
any re-distributive policy has zero marginal beneﬁt. However, in a recession when
the average marginal utility is higher than in normal times, there can be welfare
beneﬁts to government borrowing to allow households to consume more during the
recession.
<!--l. 189--><p class="indent" >  As with all social welfare measures, ours is not without ethical issues. We
have chosen our welfare measure over one with equal weights because an
equal-weights measure would be increasing with the size of any redistributive
policy.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal29.html#fn28x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">28</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-31003f28"></a>  
However, similar to Negishi weights, our welfare measure gives greater weight to households that are
well oﬀ.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal30.html#fn29x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">29</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-31005f29"></a>  
Furthermore, our welfare measure distinguishes between households that would have
suﬀered unemployment in normal times and households that are made unemployed as
a result of the recession—–giving the latter a higher weight in the social welfare
function.

<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-31010r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare6 --></a> shows the welfare measure for each policy as deﬁned by equation (<a 
href="#x1-31009r10">10<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare_def6 --></a>). The top row
of the table shows the welfare measure for implementing each policy in normal times. For
marginal policies, this is equal to one by deﬁnition. Indeed, the value for both the stimulus
check and the tax cut policy is very close to one. However, the welfare measure for the
extended unemployment policy in normal times is noticeably less than one. This is because,
although this policy is smaller in absolute size than the other policies, its consumption eﬀects
are concentrated on a small number of households that remain unemployed long enough
to receive the extended beneﬁts. For these households, the eﬀect on consumption
is large enough such that the non linearity of the consumption function leads to
smaller welfare beneﬁt than the marginal utility of consumption would otherwise
imply.
<!--l. 228--><p class="indent" >  The second row of table <a 
href="#x1-31010r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare6 --></a> shows the welfare beneﬁt of each policy in a recession without
any aggregate demand eﬀects. Again, the stimulus check and tax cut policies have measures
that are close to one—pulling forward consumption has little welfare beneﬁt for the average
household because the average marginal utility of consumption is only a little higher
than in normal times. By contrast, the policy sees beneﬁts of 1.8 dollars for every
dollar spent on extended UI beneﬁts during a recession. This is because many of
the households who are unemployed for many quarters in the recession would have
never been unemployed, or quickly reemployed, in normal times and hence their
marginal utility of consumption is much higher in the recession than in normal
times.
<!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >  The third row of the table shows the welfare measure for each policy in a recession in the
version of the model with aggregate demand eﬀects during the recession. The payroll tax cut
now has a noticeable beneﬁt, as some of the tax cut gets spent during the recession,
resulting in higher incomes for all consumers. However, the tax cut is received over a
period of two years, and much of the relief may be after the recession—and hence the
aggregate demand eﬀect—is over. Furthermore, because the payroll tax cut goes only to
employed consumers who have relatively lower MPCs, the spending out of this stimulus
will be further delayed, possibly beyond the period of the recession. By contrast,
the stimulus check is received in the ﬁrst period of the recession and goes to both
employed and unemployed consumers. The earlier arrival and higher MPCs of the
stimulus check recipients mean more of the stimulus is spent during the recession,
leading to greater aggregate demand eﬀects, higher income, and higher welfare. The
extended UI arrives, on average, slightly later than the stimulus check. However,
the recipients, who have been unemployed for at least six months, spend the extra
beneﬁts relatively quickly, resulting in signiﬁcant aggregate demand eﬀects during
the recession. In contrast to the payroll tax cut, extended UI has the beneﬁt of
automatically reducing if the recession ends early, making fewer consumers eligible for the
beneﬁt.

<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >The results presented in sections <a 
href="#x1-300004.2">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:multipliers --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-310004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a> indicate that the extension of unemployment
beneﬁts is the clear “bang for the buck” winner. The extended UI payments are well targeted
to consumers with high MPCs and high marginal utility, giving rise to large multipliers and
welfare improvements. The stimulus checks come in slightly higher when measured by their
short-term multiplier eﬀect but are a distant second when measured by their welfare eﬀects.
The stimulus checks have large initial multipliers because the money gets to consumers at the
beginning of the recession and therefore induce aggregate demand eﬀects more quickly.
However, the checks are not well targeted to high-MPC consumers, so even though the funds
arrive early in the recession, they are spent out more slowly than the extended unemployment
beneﬁts.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal32.html#fn31x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">31</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-32001f31"></a>  
Furthermore, the average recipient of a stimulus check has a much lower marginal utility than
consumers receiving unemployment beneﬁts, so the welfare beneﬁts of this policy are
substantially muted relative to UI extensions.
<!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut policy does poorly by both measures: It has a low overall
multiplier and negligible welfare beneﬁts. The reasons are that the funds are slow
to arrive, so the subsequent spending often occurs after the end of the recession,
and that the payments are particularly badly targeted—they go only to employed
consumers.
<!--l. 256--><p class="indent" >  While it is clear from the analysis that the extended unemployment beneﬁts should be the
ﬁrst tool to use, a disadvantage of them is that they are limited in their size. If a larger ﬁscal
stimulus is deemed appropriate, then stimulus checks provide an alternative option that will
stimulate spending during the recession even if the welfare beneﬁts are substantially lower
than the UI extension.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4.5 </span> <a 
 id="x1-330004.5"></a>Results in a model without the splurge</h4>
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >We introduce the splurge in our model with the aim of matching empirical evidence on the
dynamics of spending in response to transitory income shocks. The splurge acts as a stand-in
for competing theories for why agents may spend more out of those shocks than suggested by
a simple model in which forward-looking agents solely maximize utility. However,
it is natural to consider to what extent the splurge is in fact necessary to match
the empirical patterns and the implications for our results ranking the diﬀerent
policies. To assess this we reestimate the model without the splurge and recompute all
our results regarding the relative eﬀectiveness of the policies in this version of the
model.
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
<!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >  The details of this exercise are in Appendix <a 
href="#x1-37000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:Model_without_splurge --></a>. There we discuss how the estimation of the
Norwegian model in section <a 
href="#x1-180003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a> is aﬀected if we do not include splurge consumption, and the
estimation of the discount factor distributions for each education group in the US economy
without taking the splurge as given. The general result is that the we can match the liquid
wealth distributions that we target also in models that do not include a splurge. The models
do so by estimating wider distributions of discount factors than we found in section <a 
href="#x1-180003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:splurge --></a>
and <a 
href="#x1-230003.3.3">3.3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:estimBetas --></a>.
<!--l. 274--><p class="indent" >  Without the splurge the models do struggle to exactly match the dynamics of spending after
a temporary income shock, however. In particular, for the estimation of the Norwegian model,
we can compare the model’s implications for MPCs for diﬀerent wealth quartiles to empirical
estimates. Without the splurge, the model leads to an MPC for the top wealth quartile that is
far lower than in the data. In the US model this MPC is also quite low compared to the model
with splurge consumption, but for the US we do not have an empirical estimate to compare
to.
<!--l. 280--><p class="indent" >  To evaluate the impact of splurge consumption on our ranking of the policies, we simulate
the three ﬁscal policies in the reestimated model without the splurge. There are
only minor shifts in the multipliers of the policies, but the lower average MPCs
reduces multipliers for the check and tax cut policy relative to the model with the
splurge. In contrast, the UI extension becomes slighlty more eﬀective in stimulating
consumption as the wider distribution of discount factors implies a larger share of the
population that hits the borrowing constraint upon expiry of UI beneﬁts. Hence,
the extension of UI beneﬁts aﬀects agents more strongly in the model without the
splurge.
<!--l. 285--><p class="indent" >  More importantly for the main conclusion of our paper, table <a 
href="#x1-33001r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:welfare6_SplurgeComp --></a> compares the welfare
implications of the policies in the two models. Generally, the welfare metric varies only
marginally across the models. When aggregate demand eﬀects are active, we see slightly larger
diﬀerences in the welfare evaluation, with the check policy losing ground against the
UI extension. This is because the welfare impact of the check in the model with
the splurge is contingent on the checks being spent quickly due to a high average
MPC and thus generating strong aggregate demand eﬀects while the recession is
still ongoing. In the absence of the splurge only liquidity-constrained agents spend
the check money quickly, such that recession-induced aggregate demand eﬀects are
smaller.

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The main results of this paper are presented in a partial equilibrium setup with
aggregate demand eﬀects that do not arise from general equilibrium eﬀects. We
think there are many advantages to studying the welfare and multiplier eﬀects in
this setting without embedding the model in general equilibrium. First, general
equilibrium models often struggle to adequately capture the feedback mechanisms between
consumption and income, particularly the asymmetric nature of these relationships
during recessionary versus expansionary periods. Additionally, a complete general
equilibrium treatment would necessitate the analysis of numerous complex channels
including investment dynamics, ﬁrm ownership structures and dividend distribution
policies, inventory management, and international trade ﬂows—elements that, while
important in their own right, would potentially obscure the core mechanisms we aim to
investigate.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Despite the advantages of our partial equilibrium approach, here we complement our
analysis with a general equilibrium HANK and SAM model, as standard as possible, that is
able to capture supply-side eﬀects that are absent from the partial equilibrium model. In
particular, ﬁscal policies can generate labor market responses that our partial equilibrium
analysis does not address. These supply-side channels can aﬀect both the welfare implications
and the ﬁscal multipliers of diﬀerent policy interventions. Furthermore, standard to the
HANK and SAM literature, the general equilibrium model generates a self-reinforcing
precautionary saving channel that ampliﬁes business cycles. During a recession,
heightened unemployment risk prompts households to increase savings and reduce
consumption which in turn weakens both aggregate and labor demand. The resulting
decline in labor demand further raises unemployment risk, reinforcing precautionary
savings.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  We embed the consumption choices of our households—–with heterogeneity over
education type and discount factors—–in a New Keynesian model with search and
matching frictions that closely follows <a 
href="#XDu2024">Du</a> (<a 
href="#XDu2024">2024</a>), which, in turn, is in spirit of the
seminal work of <a 
href="#XRavn2017">Ravn and Sterk</a> (<a 
href="#XRavn2017">2017</a>, <a 
href="#XRavn2021">2021</a>). Aside from the household block
of the model, the framework is standard and follows from the HANK and SAM
literature. The model features nominal price rigidities à la Rotemberg, a monetary
authority that sets the nominal interest rate following a standard Taylor rule that
responds to inﬂation, and a ﬁscal authority that taxes labor income and borrows debt
from households to fund unemployment insurance and interest on past debt. As in

households randomly search for jobs and match with a labor agency that sells labor to
intermediate good producers. Complete details of the model are provided in appendix
<a 
href="#x1-41000B">B<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:hank_appendix --></a>.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  The general equilibrium structure generates ﬁscal multipliers through an intertemporal
Keynesian cross mechanism, which becomes particularly pronounced when monetary policy is
passive. Moreover, the search and matching framework allows the employment rate to respond
to policy interventions, allowing us to capture both demand and supply eﬀects of ﬁscal
policies.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >  Our approach in this section relies on linearizing the macro dynamics of the model and
employs the Sequence Space Jacobian methods developed by <a 
href="#XAuclert2021">Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie, and
Straub</a> (<a 
href="#XAuclert2021">2021</a>). This linearization imposes certain constraints on our analysis. Notably, we cannot
evaluate the eﬀects of diﬀerent policies starting from a deep recessionary state, as we do in our main
results.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal33.html#fn32x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">32</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-34001f32"></a>  
This limitation prevents us from conducting welfare comparisons between recessionary periods
and the steady state. Additionally, the Keynesian cross mechanism embedded in the model
exhibits uniform behavior regardless of the degree of economic slack—–a feature that stands
in contrast to the state-dependent multipliers we apply in our partial equilibrium
analysis.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >  Overall, the IRFs from this model are similar to those from the partial equilibrium analysis,
especially under the ﬁxed real-rate rule. Note that the magnitude of the consumption
response to the UI extension is lower than in our main analysis—a consequence of
lower long-term unemployment in this HANK exercise of deviating from the steady
state.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

Furthermore, although we are unable to repeat our welfare analysis under a recession in this
model, the distributional eﬀects of the policies are similar. Most importantly, the mechanism
leading to far greater welfare beneﬁts for the UI extension, namely that the newly unemployed
have high marginal utility, are robust to the supply-side eﬀects of a general equilibrium HANK
and SAM model.

multipliers are bigger in the HANK and SAM model. Nevertheless, in both models, the
relative ranking of the consumption multipliers over time horizons are similar, with the eﬀect
of the tax cut substantially smaller than the stimulus check or UI extension policies, despite
the inclusion of supply-side eﬀects in this HANK model. However, in contrast to
the partial equilibrium model, towards the end of the period shown the tax cut
consumption multiplier is near that of the stimulus check. This is because the aggregate
demand eﬀects in our partial equilibrium model do not continue beyond the recession,
dampening the beneﬁts of the tax cut policy—in which much of the extra spending
occurs after the recession is over—relative to the stimulus check and extended UI
policies.

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >For many years leading up to the Great Recession, a widely held view among macroeconomists
was that countercyclical policy should be left to central banks, because ﬁscal policy responses
were unpredictable in their timing, their content, and their eﬀects. Nevertheless, even during
this period, ﬁscal policy responses to recessions were repeatedly tried, perhaps because the
macroeconomists’ advice to ﬁscal policymakers — “don’t just do something; stand there”— is
not politically tenable.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic modeling has ﬁnally advanced to the point
where we can make reasonably credible assessments of the eﬀects of alternative policies of the
kinds that have been tried. The key developments have been both the advent of national
registry datasets that can measure crucial microeconomic phenomena and the creation of tools
of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic modeling that can match those micro facts and glean
their macroeconomic implications.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  We examine three ﬁscal policy experiments that have actually been implemented in the
past: an extension of UI beneﬁts, a stimulus check, and a tax cut on labor income. Our model
suggests that the extension of UI beneﬁts is a clear “bang for the buck” winner. While the
stimulus check arrives faster and generates multiplier eﬀects more quickly, it is less well
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
targeted to high-MPC households than an extension of UI beneﬁts. By contrast, the welfare
gains of extended UI beneﬁts are signiﬁcantly greater than those of a stimulus check. The chief
drawback of the UI extension is that its size is limited by the fact that a relatively small share
of the population is aﬀected by it. In contrast, stimulus checks are easily scalable while
exhibiting only slightly less recession-period stimulus (in a typical recession). However,
since some of the stimulus checks ﬂow to well-oﬀ consumers, such checks do worse
than UI extensions when we evaluate welfare consequences. Finally, the payroll tax
cut is the least eﬀective in terms of both the multiplier and welfare eﬀect, since it
targets only employed consumers and, for a typical recession, more of its payouts
are likely to occur after the recessionary period (when multipliers may exist) has
ended.
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  The tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other
policies. For example, in the COVID-driven recession, not only was the duration of UI beneﬁts
extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by substantial payments to all UI
recipients. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but the framework
could easily accommodate such an analysis.

<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >  However, the model is not quite able to match the diﬀerence in spending between the initial
year of the lottery win and the year after. The model without the splurge exhibits a higher
spending propensity in the year after the shock occurs as borrowing-constrained
agents spend the additional income quicker. The model without the splurge also
provides a worse ﬁt of the distribution of liquid wealth. Relative to the baseline
model, and to the data, the model without a splurge generates a more unequal wealth
distribution.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >  The reason for these two eﬀects, becomes apparent when considering the cross-sectional
implications of the models with and without the splurge across diﬀerent wealth quartiles.
While the model with the splurge can account for the empirically-observed initial MPCs
among the wealthiest, the model without the splurge exhibits much lower MPCs among that
group, see Table <a 
href="#x1-38008r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Comparison_Splurge_Table --></a>. The wealthiest group will thus be very patient and have low MPCs, which

with substantial overlap between these two groups). This is shown in the two panels in

<!--l. 180--><p class="indent" >  Finally, we again consider the implications of our model for the dynamics of spending over
time and for the dynamics of spending for households that remain unemployed long enough for
unemployment beneﬁts to expire. Figure <a 
href="#x1-39005r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:untargetedMoments_wSplZero --></a> repeats Figure <a 
href="#x1-24004r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:untargetedMoments --></a> with results from the model
without splurge consumption added. The implication is that the model without a splurge leads
to a slightly too low MPC in the year of a lottery win and a slightly higher MPC in the year
after.
<!--l. 185--><p class="indent" >  The drop in spending when unemployment beneﬁts expire is virtually the same in the
model without splurge consumption (17 percent versus 18 percent in the baseline).
While the consumption dynamics across the models with and without a splurge
are fairly similar, the underlying drivers of the consumption drop upon expiry of
unemployment beneﬁts are diﬀerent. In the model with the splurge, the drop in income
translates directly into lower consumption via the splurge itself. In the model without
the splurge it is the sharp rise in agents hitting the borrowing constraint which
accounts for the consumption drop after UI beneﬁts expire. This is shown in the
solid and dashed red lines in Figure <a 
href="#x1-39004r2">8b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:expiryUI_wSplZero --></a>, and is due to the wider distribution of
discount factors that is needed to match the wealth distributions in the model without
the splurge. This leads to a greater number of agents being close the borrowing
constraint.

<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >In this section we simulate the three ﬁscal policies from the main text in the estimated model
without the splurge. The shape of the impulse response functions only marginally change
relative to the model with the splurge. Hence, we focus on the quantitative changes as
summarized by the cumulative multipliers in Figure <a 
href="#x1-40001r10">10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:cumulativemultipliers_SplurgeComp --></a>. The ﬁgure shows the multipliers when
AD eﬀects are switched on for the model with and without the splurge. Table <a 
href="#x1-40002r11">11<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier_SplurgeComp --></a> shows the
10y-horizon multiplier across the two models.
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent" >  The absence of the splurge entails a calibration with a lower average MPC in the
population. Hence, the check and tax cut exhibit lower multipliers when there is no splurge.
For the UI extension we observe the opposite pattern, as the multiplier is larger in the model
without the splurge. This due to the consumption dynamics around the expiry of
UI beneﬁts described in the previous section. In the model without the splurge
more agents hit the borrowing constraint upon the expiry of beneﬁts. Providing
those agents with an extension of UI beneﬁts thus turns out to be slightly more
powerful.
<!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >  The policy ranking in terms of the multiplier shifts slighlty. In the model with the splurge,
the check policy delivers multiplier eﬀects much more rapidly than the UI extension. In the
model without splurge consumption, the UI extension appears superior to the check, both at
shorter and longer horizons. Both models agree on the tax cut being the least eﬀective
policy.
