<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >  <a 
 id="abstract"></a> Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match measured spending dynamics over
four years following an income shock (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)), we assess the
eﬀectiveness of three ﬁscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions. Unemployment
insurance (UI) extensions are the clear “bang for the buck” winner when eﬀectiveness is
measured in utility terms. Stimulus checks are second best and have two advantages (over
UI): they arrive and are spent faster, and they are scalable to any desired size. A
temporary (two-year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less eﬀective than
the other policies and has negligible eﬀects in the version of our model without a
multiplier.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Fiscal policies that aim to boost consumer spending in recessions have been tried in many
countries in recent decades. The nature of such policies has varied widely, perhaps because
traditional macroeconomic models have not provided plausible guidance about which policies
are likely to be most eﬀective—either in reducing misery (a ‘welfare metric’) or in increasing
output (a ‘GDP metric’).
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  But a new generation of macro models has shown that when microeconomic heterogeneity
across consumer circumstances (wealth; income; education) is taken into account, the
consequences of an income shock for consumer spending depend on a measurable object: the
intertemporal marginal propensity to consume (IMPC) introduced in <a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">Auclert, Rognlie, and
Straub</a> (<a 
href="#Xauclert2018IKC">2018</a>). The IMPC extends the notion of marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
to account for the speed at which households spend. Fortuitously, new sources of
microeconomic data, particularly from Scandinavian national registries, have recently
allowed the ﬁrst reasonably credible measurements of the IMPC (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and
Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>)).
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Even in models that can match a given measured IMPC pattern, the relative merits of
alternative policies depend profoundly on the both the metric (welfare or GDP) and on the
quantitative structure of the rest of the model – for example, whether multipliers exist and
how they work. Here, after constructing a microeconomically credible heterogeneous agent
(HA) model, we examine its implications for how optimal stimulus policies depend on the
existence, nature, and timing of any “multipliers,” which, following <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman, and
Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>), we model in a clean and simple way. As a result, the interaction of
the multiplier (if any) with the other elements of the model is reasonably easy to
understand.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  By “microeconomically credible,” we mean a model that can match three things that we
take to be stylized facts: (1) the measured IMPCs from <a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>),
(2) the cross-sectional distribution of liquid wealth (following <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>)’s
deﬁnition of liquid wealth) and (3) the spending induced by the unanticipated transitory shock
is “front-loaded.” What we mean by this is that a fairly standard HA model (speciﬁcally, the
model in <a 
href="#XcstwMPC">Carroll, Slacalek, Tokuoka, and White</a> (<a 
href="#XcstwMPC">2017</a>)) can match both the initial
distribution of liquid wealth, and the pattern of spending in periods after the shock arrives.
But the prediction of that model for spending in the initial period is far below the actual
spending measured. We call the extra spending that happens immediately in the
period of receipt of the stimulus a “splurge.” The evidence of front-loading from
<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>) is consistent with ﬁndings elsewhere in the
literature.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal2.html#fn1x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>  
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  Our model’s main innovation relative to the existing literature is designed speciﬁcally to
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
match the evidence of front-loading. (If we were unable to reject the hypothesis that the
required splurge was zero, we would not need to add the splurge). Speciﬁcally, our splurge
assumption is that consumers spend a ﬁxed fraction of their labor income each period. This
spending occurs regardless of their current wealth and ﬁts with the above-cited empirical
evidence on front-loading as well as the evidence that even high-liquid-wealth households have
high initial MPCs (see <a 
href="#Xcrawley2023MicroMacro">Crawley and Kuchler</a> (<a 
href="#Xcrawley2023MicroMacro">2023</a>), and the extensive literature cited
therein). This ‘splurge’ model is also consistent with evidence, from <a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">Ganong and Noel</a> (<a 
href="#XganongConsumer2019">2019</a>),
that spending drops sharply following the large and predictable drop in income after the
exhaustion of unemployment beneﬁts (which a model without the splurge would not be able to
match).<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal3.html#fn2x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1003f2"></a>  
The resulting structural model could be used to evaluate a wide variety of consumption
stimulus policies. We examine three that have been implemented in recent recessions in the
United States (and elsewhere): an extension of unemployment insurance (UI) beneﬁts, a
means-tested stimulus check, and a payroll tax cut. (We assume all these policies are debt
ﬁnanced; see section <a 
href="#x1-3001r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:model --></a> for details.)
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >  Our ﬁrst metric of policy eﬀectiveness is “multiplication bang for the buck”: For a dollar of
spending on a particular policy, how much multiplication is induced? Timing matters because
in our model (following the empirical literature), the size of any “consumption multiplier”
depends on the economic conditions that prevail when the extra spending occurs. Our strategy
to illuminate this point is twofold. First, we calculate the policy-induced spending dynamics in
an economy with no multiplier (and, therefore, with no multiplication-bang-for-the-buck).
We then follow <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>)’s approach to modeling the
aggregate demand externality. In their approach, output depends mechanically on the
level of consumption relative to steady state. But in contrast to <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">Krueger, Mitman,
and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook2016">2016</a>), the aggregate demand externality in our model is switched on
only when the economy is experiencing a recession—there is no multiplication for
spending that occurs after our simulated recession is over. A less stark assumption
(for example, the degree of multiplication depends on the distance of the economy
from its steady state, or the endogenous time-varying multiplication that arises in a
New-Keynesian model) would perhaps be more realistic but also much harder to assess
clearly.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal4.html#fn3x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1005f3"></a>  
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >  Because our model’s outcomes reﬂect the behavior of utility-maximizing consumers, we can
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
calculate another, possibly more interesting, measure of the eﬀectiveness of alternative
policies: their eﬀect on consumers’ welfare. Even without multiplication, a utility-based metric
can justify countercyclical policy because the larger idiosyncratic shocks to income that occur
during a recession may justify a greater-than-normal degree of social insurance. We call this
‘welfare bang for the buck.’
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >  The principal diﬀerence between the two metrics is that what matters for the degree of
spending multiplication is how much of the policy-induced extra spending occurs during the
recession (when the multiplier matters), while eﬀectiveness in the utility metric also depends
on who is doing the extra spending (because diﬀerent recipients have very diﬀerent marginal
utilities).
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >  In the case of the policies compared here, an advantage of the stimulus checks (as we model
them) is that they are distributed immediately upon commencement of the recession, when
the multiplier is fully in force; our model implies that much of the induced extra spending
occurs soon enough that it is multiplied. UI payments immediately increase spending by
reducing the precautionary saving motive but, because “extended” UI payments may be made
after the recession is over, a substantial proportion of UI-extension-induced spending
will occur when there is no multiplier. However, the fact that UI recipients have
a high MPC implies that the <span 
class="ecti-1200">utility </span>consequences of the UI policy for them will
still be considerable, even if their post-recession spending does not get multiplied
(section <a 
href="#x1-170004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:comparing --></a>).
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  Because high-MPC consumers have high marginal utility, a standard aggregated
welfare function would favor redistribution to such consumers even in the absence of
a recession. We are interested in the degree of <span 
class="ecti-1200">extra </span>motivation for redistributive
policies present in a recession, so we construct our social welfare metric speciﬁcally to
measure only the <span 
class="ecti-1200">incremental </span>social welfare eﬀect of alternative policies during
recessions (beyond whatever redistributional logic might apply during expansions – see
section <a 
href="#x1-230004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a>).
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  Households do not prepare for our “MIT shock” recessions, which double the unemployment
rate and the average length of unemployment spells. The end of the recession occurs
as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an average recession length of six quarters,
leading to a return of the unemployment rate to normal levels over time. When the
multiplier is active, any reduction in aggregate consumption below its steady-state level
directly reduces aggregate productivity and thus labor income. Hence, any policy
stimulating consumption will also boost incomes through this aggregate demand multiplier
channel.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  Our results are intuitive. In the economy with no recession multiplier, the beneﬁt of a sustained payroll tax
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
cut is negligible.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="HAFiscal5.html#fn4x0"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1007f4"></a>  
When a multiplier exists, the tax cut has more beneﬁts, especially if the recession continues
long enough that most of the spending induced by the tax cut happens while the economy is
still in recession (and the multiplier still is in force). The typical recession, however, ends long
before our “sustained” wage tax cut is reversed—and even longer before lower-MPC consumers
have spent down most of their extra after-tax income. Accordingly, even in an economy with a
multiplier that is powerful during recessions, much of the wage tax cut’s eﬀect on
consumption occurs when any multiplier that might have existed in a recession is no longer
operative.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  Even leaving aside any multiplier eﬀects, the stimulus checks have more value than the
wage tax cut, because at least a portion of such checks go to unemployed people
who have both high MPCs and high marginal utilities (while wage tax cuts, by
deﬁnition, go only to persons who are employed and earning wages). The greatest
“welfare bang for the buck” comes from the UI insurance extension, because almost
<span 
class="ecti-1200">all </span>of the recipients are in circumstances in which they have a high MPC and a
high marginal utility, whether or not the multiplier aggregate demand externality
exists.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >  And, in contrast to the wage-tax cut, both the UI extension and the stimulus checks
concentrate most of the marginal increment to consumption at times when the multiplier (if it
exists) is still powerful. A disadvantage of the UI extension, in terms of “multiplied bang for
the buck,” is that (relative to the assumed-to-be-immediate-upon-recession checks), more of
any extended UI payouts are likely to occur after the recession is over (when, by assumption,
there is no multiplication). Countering this disadvantage is the fact that the MPC of UI
recipients is higher than that of stimulus check recipients and furthermore the insurance
nature of the UI payments reduces the precautionary saving motive; in the end, our model
says that these two forces roughly balance each other, so that the “multiplied bang for the
buck” of the two policies is similar. In this multiplier metric, the stimulus check is slightly
more eﬀective despite the fact it is not well targeted to high-MPC households. In the welfare
metric, however, there is considerable marginal value to UI recipients who receive their
beneﬁts after the recession is over (and no multiplier exists), so in the welfare metric, the
relative value of UI beneﬁts is increased compared with the policy of sending stimulus
checks.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >  We conclude that extended UI beneﬁts should be the ﬁrst weapon employed from this
arsenal, as they have a greater welfare beneﬁt than stimulus checks and a similar “multiplied
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
bang for the buck.” But a disadvantage is that the total amount of stimulus that can be
accomplished with the UI extension is constrained by the fact that only a limited
number of people become unemployed. If more stimulation is called for than can be
accomplished via the UI extension, checks have the advantage that their eﬀects scale almost
linearly in the size of the stimulus—see <a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">Beraja and Zorzi</a> (<a 
href="#Xberaja2023size">2023</a>) for a more detailed
exposition of the relation between MPC and stimulus size. The wage tax cut is also, in
principle, scalable, but its eﬀects are smaller than those of checks because recipients
have lower MPCs and marginal utility than check and UI recipients. In the real
world, a tax cut is also likely the least ﬂexible of the three tools: UI beneﬁts can be
further extended, and multiple rounds of checks can be sent, but multiple rounds of
changes in payroll tax rates would likely be administratively and politically more
diﬃcult.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >  One theme of our paper is that which policies are better or worse, and by how much,
depends on both the quantitative details of the policies and the quantitative modeling of the
economy.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  But the tools we are using could be easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other policies.
For example, in the COVID-19 recession in the US, not only was the duration of UI beneﬁts
extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by very substantial extra payments to
every UI recipient. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but the
framework could easily accommodate such an analysis.

<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >Several papers have looked at ﬁscal policies that have been implemented in the U.S. under the
lens of a structural model. <a 
href="#Xcoenen2012effects">Coenen, Erceg, Freedman, Furceri, Kumhof, Lalonde,
Laxton, Lindé, Mourougane, Muir, et al.</a> (<a 
href="#Xcoenen2012effects">2012</a>) analyses the eﬀects of diﬀerent
ﬁscal policies using seven diﬀerent models. The models are variants of two-agent
heterogeneous agent models and make no attempt to match the full distribution of
liquid wealth as we do in this paper. We also attempt to match the microdata on
household consumption behavior, much of which has come more recently. More closely
aligned to the methodology of our paper are <a 
href="#Xmckay2016role">McKay and Reis</a> (<a 
href="#Xmckay2016role">2016</a>) and <a 
href="#Xmckay2021optimal">McKay and
Reis</a> (<a 
href="#Xmckay2021optimal">2021</a>) which both look at the role of automatic stabilizers. By contrast, we
consider discretionary policies that have been invoked after a recession has begun.
Another related paper is <a 
href="#Xbayercoronavirus">Bayer, Born, Luetticke, and Müller</a> (<a 
href="#Xbayercoronavirus">2023</a>) who studies
ﬁscal policies implemented during the pandemic. They ﬁnd that targeted stimulus
through an increase in unemployment beneﬁts has a much larger multiplier than
an untargeted policy. In contrast, we ﬁnd that untargeted stimulus checks have
slightly higher multiplier eﬀects when compared with a targeted policy extending
eligibility for unemployment insurance. Our results derive from the fact that—as
in the data—even high liquid wealth consumers have relatively high MPCs in our
model.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >  This paper is also closely related to the empirical literature that aims to estimate the
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
eﬀect of transitory income shocks and stimulus payments. We particularly focus on
<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">Fagereng, Holm, and Natvik</a> (<a 
href="#Xfagereng_mpc_2021">2021</a>), who use Norwegian administrative panel data with
sizable lottery wins to estimate the MPC out of transitory income in that year, as
well as the pattern of expenditure in the following years. We build a model that is
consistent with the patterns they identify. Examples of the literature that followed the
Great Recession in 2008 are <a 
href="#Xparker2013consumer">Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland</a> (<a 
href="#Xparker2013consumer">2013</a>) and
<a 
href="#Xbroda2014economic">Broda and Parker</a> (<a 
href="#Xbroda2014economic">2014</a>). These papers exploit the eﬀectively random timing of the
distribution of stimulus payments and identify a substantial consumption response.
The results indicate an MPC that is diﬃcult to reconcile with representative agent
models.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >  Thus, the paper relates to the literature presenting HA models that aim to be consistent
with the evidence from the micro-data. An example is <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>), who build
a model where agents save in both liquid and illiquid assets. The model yields a substantial
consumption response to a stimulus payment, since MPCs are high both for constrained,
low-wealth households and for households with substantial net worth that is mainly invested
in the illiquid asset (the “wealthy hand-to-mouth”). <a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">Carroll, Crawley, Slacalek, and
White</a> (<a 
href="#Xcarroll2020modeling">2020</a>) present an HA model that is similar in many respects to the one we study.
Their focus is on predicting the consumption response to the 2020 U.S. CARES Act that
contains both an extension of unemployment beneﬁts and a stimulus check. However, neither
of these papers attempts to evaluate and rank the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent stimulus policies, as
we do.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  <a 
href="#XkaplanMPC2022">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a

high MPC and the tension between that and ﬁtting the distribution of aggregate wealth. We
use one of the mechanisms they consider, <span 
class="ecti-1200">ex-ante </span>heterogeneity in discount factors, and build
a model that delivers both high average MPCs and a distribution of liquid wealth consistent
with the data. The model allows for splurge consumption and thus also delivers substantial
MPCs for high-liquid-wealth households. This helps the model match not only the initial
MPC, but also the propensity to spend out of a windfall for several periods after it is
obtained.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >  In our model, consumers do not adjust their labor supply in response to the stimulus

the literature is conﬂicted on this subject and <a

<a

the period from 2008 to 2014. He ﬁnds that this extension raised aggregate demand and
implied a lower unemployment rate than without the policy. However, he does not attempt
to compare the stimulus eﬀects of extending unemployment insurance with other
policies.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >  One criterion to rank policies is the extent to which spending is “multiplied,” and our paper
therefore relates to the vast literature discussing the size and timing of any multiplier. Our

papers such as <a

href="#Xeggertsson2011fiscal">Eggertsson</a> (<a

href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">Hagedorn, Manovskii, and
Mitman</a> (<a 
href="#Xhagedorn2019fiscal">2019</a>) present an HA model with both incomplete markets and nominal
rigidities to evaluate the size of the ﬁscal multiplier and also ﬁnd that it is higher when
monetary policy is constrained. Unlike us, they focus on government spending instead of
transfers and are interested in diﬀerent options for ﬁnancing that spending. <a 
href="#Xbroer2023fiscalmultipliers">Broer,
Krusell, and Öberg</a> (<a 
href="#Xbroer2023fiscalmultipliers">2023</a>) also focus on ﬁscal multipliers for government spending and
show how they diﬀer in representative agent and HA models with diﬀerent sources
of nominal rigidities. <a 
href="#Xramey2018government">Ramey and Zubairy</a> (<a 
href="#Xramey2018government">2018</a>) investigate empirically whether
there is support for the model-based results that ﬁscal multipliers are higher in
certain states. While they ﬁnd evidence that multipliers are higher when there is slack
in the economy or the ZLB binds, the multipliers they ﬁnd are still below one in
most speciﬁcations. In any case, we condition on policies being implemented in a
recession—when, this literature argues, multipliers are higher—but it is not crucial for our
purposes whether the multipliers are greater than one or not. We are concerned with
relative multipliers, and the multiplier is only one of the two criteria we use to rank
policies.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >  The second criterion to rank policies is our measure of welfare. Thus, the paper relates to
the recent literature on welfare comparisons in HA models. Both <a

welfare eﬀects. In the former case, these are aggregate eﬃciency, redistribution and
insurance, while the latter further decomposes the insurance part into intra- and
intertemporal components. These papers are related to ours, but we do not decompose the
welfare eﬀects. Regardless of decomposition, we want to (1) use a welfare measure as
an additional way of ranking policies and (2) introduce a measure that abstracts
from any incentive for a planner to redistribute in the steady state (or “normal”
times).

<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >We model the arrival of a recession, and the government policy response to it, as an
unpredictable event—an MIT shock. We have four types of shocks: one representing a
recession and one for each of the three diﬀerent policy responses we consider. The policy

counterfactual in which the policy response occurs without a recession in order to understand
the welfare eﬀects of the policy.

  At the onset of a recession, several changes occur. First, the unemployment rate for each
education group doubles: Those who would have been unemployed in the absence of a
recession are still unemployed, and an additional number of consumers move from employment
to unemployment. Second, conditional on the recession continuing, the employment transition
matrix is adjusted so that unemployment remains at the new high level and the expected
length of time for an unemployment spell increases. In our baseline calibration, discussed in
detail in section <a 
href="#x1-150003.3">3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:calib --></a>, we set the expected length of an unemployment spell to one
and a half quarters in normal times, and this length increases to four quarters in a
recession. Third, the end of the recession occurs as a Bernoulli process calibrated for an
average length of recession of six quarters. Finally, at the end of a recession, the
employment transition matrix switches back to its original probabilities, and, as
a result, the unemployment rate trends down over time, back to its steady-state
level.

  In this policy response, the government sends money to every consumer that directly
increases the individual’s market resources. The checks are means-tested depending on
permanent income. A check for $1,200 is sent to every consumer with permanent income less
than $100,000, and this amount is then linearly reduced to zero for consumers with a
permanent income greater than $150,000. Similar policies were implemented in the U.S. in
2001, 2008, and during the pandemic.

  In this policy response, unemployment beneﬁts are extended from two quarters to four
quarters. That is, those who become unemployed at the start of the recession, or who were
already unemployed, will receive unemployment beneﬁts for up to four quarters (including
quarters leading up to the recession). Those who become unemployed one quarter into the
recession will receive up to three quarters of unemployment beneﬁts. These extended
unemployment beneﬁts will occur regardless of whether the recession ends, and
no further extensions are granted if the recession continues. This policy reﬂects
temporary changes made to unemployment beneﬁts in the U.S. following the great
recession.

employed consumers’ income is increased by 2 percent. The income of unemployed consumers

  Some work in the HA macro literature has shown that if taxes are raised immediately to
oﬀset any ﬁscal stimulus, results can be very diﬀerent than they would be if, as occurs in
reality, recessionary policies are debt ﬁnanced. Typical ﬁscal rules assume that any increase in
debt gets ﬁnanced over a long interval. Since much of our analysis eﬀectively normalizes our
policies’ size so that the total cost of each policy (and therefore the associated debt) is the
same, almost all of the eﬀects of any particular ﬁscal rule should be very similar for each of
our policies so long as the great majority of the debt is repaid after the short recessionary
period that is our main focus.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >  To keep our analysis as simple as possible, we assume that our policies are debt ﬁnanced
and that none of the policy-induced government debt is repaid during that short period.
Any of a variety of ﬁscal rules could be imposed for the period following our short
period of interest, but we did not want to choose any particular ﬁscal rule in order to
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
avoid making a choice that should have little consequence for our key question.
Advocates of alternative ﬁscal rules likely already have intuitions about how such
rules’ economic consequences diﬀer, but under our approach, those consequences
should be nearly the same for all three policies we consider. Alternative choices of
ﬁscal rules should therefore not aﬀect the ranking of policies that is our principal
concern.

<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >  The splurge is essential in matching the empirical evidence mentioned above. If we impose a
zero splurge in our estimation, the model is not able to account for the exact empirical
proﬁles. In order to generate a high initial marginal propensity to consume, the estimation
yields a very wide distribution of discount factors (<img

that suﬃcient agents are at the liquidity constraint and sensitive to transitory income shocks
to generate a high initial MPC in absence of the splurge. However, the large diﬀerences in
discount factor lead to a strongly unequal distribution of liquid wealth, exceeding that
observed in data. The model without the splurge also misses the time proﬁle of the marginal
propensity to consume and the distribution of initial consumption responses across wealth
quartiles. Speciﬁcally, the model cannot account for the high initial MPC among the
wealthiest. To compensate for that, the estimation yields more liquidity-constrained
agents, and thus a higher MPC among the least wealthy. This in turn leads also to a
higher spending propensity in the ﬁrst year after the shock as liquidity-constrained
agents spend the additional income quicker. Overall, the model ﬁt with the data
deteriorates roughly by a factor of two measured by the Euclidean norm of the targeting
error.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >  The shortcomings of the model without a splurge are likely to aﬀect the derived policy
recommendations, for two reasons. First, if multipliers are larger during recessions and the
recession length is stochastic, the exact timing of induced consumption matters for the
policies’ overall eﬀectiveness. A recession-dependent multiplier will in particular magnify the
already sizeable diﬀerence in predicted consumption responses in year 1 and 2 across the
models with and without the splurge. Second, the welfare impacts of the policies will depend
on how the policies aﬀect consumption responses across the wealth distribution. The model
without the splurge predicts - counterfactually - that consumption responses are concentrated
among the poorest (that are most likely to be aﬀected by recession-induced unemployment).
The model with the splurge can instead accurately capture consumption responses across the
wealth distribution.

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Before we move on to the parameterization of the full model, we describe in detail the data
that we use to get measures of permanent income, liquid wealth, and the division of
households into educational groups in the United States. We use data on the distribution of
liquid wealth from the 2004 wave of the SCF. We restrict our attention to households where
the head is of working age, which we deﬁne to be in the range from 25 to 62. The SCF-variable
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
“normal annual income” is our measure of the household’s permanent income, and, to exclude
outliers, we drop the observations that make up the bottom 5 percent of the distribution of
this variable. The smallest value of permanent income for households in our sample is thus
$16,708.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >  Liquid wealth is deﬁned as in <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>) and consists of cash, money
market, checking, savings, and call accounts; directly held mutual funds; and stocks and
bonds. We subtract oﬀ liquid debt, which is the revolving debt on credit card balances. Note
that the SCF does not contain information on cash holdings, so these are imputed with the
procedure described in Appendix B.1 of <a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">Kaplan and Violante</a> (<a 
href="#Xkaplan2014model">2014</a>), which also describes the
credit card balances that are considered part of liquid debt. We drop any households that have
negative liquid wealth.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >  Households are classiﬁed into three educational groups. The ﬁrst group, “Dropout,”
applies to households where the head of household has not obtained a high school
diploma; the second group, “Highschool,” includes heads of households who have a high
school diploma and those who, in addition, have some years of college education
without obtaining a bachelor’s degree; and the third group, “College,” consists of
heads of households who have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher. With this
classiﬁcation of the education groups, the Dropout group makes up <img

MPCs relative to wealth, and (2) we calibrate to liquid wealth rather than total

the start of a recession, and we compare results both with and without aggregate demand
eﬀects being active during the recession. First, we present impulse responses of aggregate
income and consumption after the implementation of each policy. Then we compare the
policies in terms of their cumulative multipliers and in terms of their eﬀect on a welfare

<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-19001r3">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessioncheckrelrecession --></a> shows the impulse response of income and consumption when stimulus checks are
issued in the ﬁrst quarter of a recession. In the model without a multiplier, the stimulus checks
account for 5.5 percent of the ﬁrst quarter’s income. In the following quarters, there are no
further stimulus payments, and income remains the same as it would have been without the
stimulus check policy. Consumption is about 3 percent higher in the ﬁrst quarter, which
includes the splurge response to the stimulus check. Consumption then drops to less than 1
percent above the counterfactual, and the remainder of the stimulus check money is then spent
over the next few years. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income in the
ﬁrst quarter is 6.5 percent higher than the counterfactual, as the extra spending
feeds into higher incomes. Consumption in this model jumps to a higher level than
without aggregate demand eﬀects and comes down more slowly as the feedback eﬀects
from consumption to income damp the speed with which income—and hence the
splurge—return to zero. After a couple of years, when the recession is most likely over and
aggregate demand eﬀects are no longer in place, income is close to where it would
be without the stimulus check policy, although consumption remains somewhat
elevated.

<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >  The impulse responses in ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-20001r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessionuirelrecession --></a> show the response to a policy that extends unemployment
beneﬁts from 6 months to 12 months for a period of a year. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, the path for income now depends on the number of consumers who receive
the extended unemployment beneﬁts. These consumers are those who have been
unemployed for between 6 and 12 months. In the ﬁrst quarter of the recession, the newly
unemployed receive unemployment beneﬁts regardless of whether they are extended or not.
Therefore, it is in the second and third quarters, when the eﬀects of the recession on
long-term unemployment start to materialize, that the extended UI payments ramp up,
amounting to an aggregate increase in quarterly income by 0.7 percent. By the ﬁfth
quarter, the policy is no longer in eﬀect, and income from extended unemployment
goes to zero. Consumption in the ﬁrst quarter jumps by more than income (by 0.3
percent), prompted by both the increase in expected income and the reduced need for
precautionary saving given the extended insurance. In the model without aggregate
demand eﬀects, consumption is only a little above the counterfactual by the time
the policy is over. In the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, there is an extra
boost to income of about the same size in the ﬁrst and second quarters. As this
extra aggregate demand induced income goes to employed consumers, more of it is
saved, and consumption remains elevated several quarters beyond the end of the
policy.

<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  The ﬁnal impulse response graph, ﬁgure <a 
href="#x1-21001r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:recessiontaxcutrelrecession --></a>, shows the impulse response for a payroll tax cut
that persists for two years (eight quarters). In the model without aggregate demand eﬀects,
income rises by close to 2 percent as the take-home pay for employed consumers goes up. After
the two-year period, income drops back to where it would have been without the
payroll tax cut. Consumption jumps close to 1.3 percent in response to the tax cut.
Over the period in which the tax cut is in eﬀect, consumption rises somewhat as
the stock of precautionary savings goes up, before declining in anticipation of the
drop in income at the two-year mark. Following the drop in income, consumption
drops sharply because of the splurge and then decreases over time as consumers
spend out the savings they built up over the period the tax cut was in eﬀect. In
the model with aggregate demand eﬀects, income rises by about 2.5 percent above
the counterfactual and then declines steadily as the probability that the recession
remains active—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀects in place—goes down over
time.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-21002f17"></a>  
In response to the now declining expected path for income over the two years during which the
tax cut remains in place, consumption also declines, albeit at a slightly slower pace.
Following the end of the policy, the savings stock in the model with aggregate demand
eﬀects is high, and consumption remains signiﬁcantly elevated through the period
shown.

href="#x1-22002r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> shows
the 10y-horizon multiplier for each policy. The stimulus check, which is paid out
in quarter one, exhibits the largest multiplier on impact. About 60 percent of the
total policy expenditure is immediately spent by consumers. After one year, and
because of the aggregate demand eﬀects, consumption has increased cumulatively
by more than the cost of the stimulus check. Over time, the policy reaches a total
multiplier of 1.245. Without AD eﬀects the policy only generates a multiplier of
0.872.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >  The multiplier is slightly lower for the UI extension policy than the stimulus check over
most horizons. Since spending for the UI policy is spread out over four quarters (and peaks in
quarters two to three), the multiplier in the ﬁrst quarter is considerably lower than in the case
of the stimulus check. The UI extension policy is targeted in the sense that it provides
additional income to only those consumers, who, because of unemployment, have large MPCs.
However, it is slow to roll out, and some of the spending occurs at later quarters, when the
recession might have ended. Overall, around 80 percent of the policy expenditure occurs
during the recession. In contrast, the stimulus check is paid out fully during the ﬁrst quarter,
when, by construction, the recession occurs with certainty. Therefore, the aggregate demand
eﬀects are particularly potent for the stimulus check policy despite being less targeted
and providing stimulus also to agents with low MPCs relative to the extended UI
policy.

<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut has the lowest multiplier irrespective of the considered horizon. A
multiplier of 1 is reached only after 10 years with AD eﬀects. These relatively small numbers
reﬂect that policy spending lasts for a long time and is thus more likely to occur after the
recession has ended. Moreover, only employed consumers, often with relatively low MPCs,
beneﬁt directly from the payroll tax cut. Therefore, the policy is poorly targeted if the goal is
to provide short-term stimulus.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-22002r4">4<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:Multiplier --></a> contains an additional (middle) row. To understand these values note that the
policies initially increase the income of consumers directly, which leads to a boost in
consumption. As a consequence, this boost triggers an aggregate demand eﬀect which
increases the income of everyone and in turn leads to an additional boost to consumption. We
refer to the sum of this initial and the indirect boost to consumption as the ﬁrst-round
AD eﬀect. However, the AD eﬀect continues as the indirect boost to consumption
triggers another round of income increases which further boost consumption and
so on. One might argue that these higher-order rounds of the AD eﬀect are not
likely to be anticipated by consumers. Since higher-order consumption boosts only
materialize if consumers anticipate them and act accordingly, the overall increase in
consumption might turn out to be smaller than suggested by the full AD eﬀect. The
middle row of the table shows the multipliers that result in the special case where we
only consider the ﬁrst-round AD eﬀect. As expected, the multipliers are smaller
when excluding higher-order rounds. Nevertheless, the ranking of the policies remain
unchanged.

The table shows consumption-equivalent welfare gains in basis points, which are to be
interpreted as follows. A welfare gain of <img

between the stimulus policy being implemented in response to a recession and a permanent
increase in the baseline consumption of the total population by <img 
src="HAFiscal151x.svg" alt="x  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> basis points (that is a
one-hundredth of 1 percent of the baseline consumption). We will, however, ﬁrst discuss the
relative diﬀerences across the policies and then discuss the magnitude of the welfare
eﬀects.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  Without aggregate demand eﬀects (the ﬁrst row of the table), the payroll tax cut has
extremely limited welfare beneﬁts compared with the other policies. The reason is that the
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
payroll tax cut goes to consumers who remain employed, and therefore it does not directly
aﬀect the unemployed consumers who are the most hit by the recession. However, employed
consumers do reduce their consumption at the onset of the recession because of the increased
unemployment risk, so the tax cut helps them more than in nonrecessionary times.
Similarly, the stimulus check has limited beneﬁts relative to the UI policy, as it mostly
goes to employed consumers, although it has the beneﬁt over the payroll tax cut of
also reaching the unemployed. The extended UI policy is the clear “bang for the
buck” winner, as all the payments go to unemployed households who are likely to
have signiﬁcantly higher marginal utility for consumption than in nonrecessionary
times.
<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >  The second row of the table shows the welfare beneﬁts in the version of the model with
aggregate demand eﬀects during the recession. The payroll tax cut now has a noticeable
beneﬁt, as some of the tax cut gets spent during the recession, resulting in higher incomes for
all consumers. However, the tax cut is received over a period of two years, and much of the
relief may be after the recession—and hence the aggregate demand eﬀect—is over.
Furthermore, because the payroll tax cut goes only to employed consumers who have relatively
lower MPCs, the spending out of this stimulus will be further delayed, possibly beyond the
period of the recession. By contrast, the stimulus check is received in the ﬁrst period of the
recession and goes to both employed and unemployed consumers. The earlier arrival and
higher MPCs of the stimulus check recipients mean more of the stimulus is spent during the
recession, leading to greater aggregate demand eﬀects, higher income, and higher welfare. The
extended UI arrives, on average, slightly later than the stimulus check. However,
the recipients, who have been unemployed for at least six months, spend the extra
beneﬁts relatively quickly, resulting in signiﬁcant aggregate demand eﬀects during
the recession. In contrast to the payroll tax cut, extended UI has the beneﬁt of
automatically reducing if the recession ends early, making fewer consumers eligible for the
beneﬁt.
<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >  The welfare eﬀects for the UI extension are largest compared with other stimulus policies
when those policies are scaled down to match the total expenditure size of the UI extension
policy. Nevertheless, the welfare eﬀect of the UI extension is relatively modest, amounting to
only 1.101 basis points of baseline consumption. However, while the UI extension policy
cannot be easily scaled to a larger size, scaling is certainly possible for the stimulus check. If
we consider a $1,200 stimulus check rather than the $80 check underlying the calculations in
table <a 
href="#x1-23017r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: welfare --></a>, we obtain—using a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation—a welfare gain equivalent

<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >The results presented in sections <a 
href="#x1-220004.2">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:multipliers --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-230004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a> indicate that the extension of unemployment
beneﬁts is the clear “bang for the buck” winner. The extended UI payments are well
targeted to consumers with high MPCs and high marginal utility, giving rise to large
multipliers and welfare improvements. The stimulus checks come in slightly higher
when measured by their multiplier eﬀect but are a distant second when measured by
their welfare eﬀects. The stimulus checks have large multipliers because the money
gets to consumers at the beginning of the recession and is therefore most likely
to be spent during the recession when spending passes through to productivity.
However, the checks are not well targeted to high-MPC consumers, so even though
the funds arrive early in the recession, they are spent out more slowly than the
extended unemployment beneﬁts. Furthermore, the average recipient of a stimulus
check has a much lower marginal utility than consumers receiving unemployment
beneﬁts, so the welfare beneﬁts of this policy are substantially muted relative to UI
extensions.
<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >  The payroll tax cut policy does poorly by both measures: It has a low overall
multiplier and negligible welfare beneﬁts. The reasons are that the funds are slow
to arrive, so the subsequent spending often occurs after the end of the recession,
and that the payments are particularly badly targeted—they go only to employed
consumers.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >  While it is clear from the analysis that the extended unemployment beneﬁts should be the
ﬁrst tool to use, a disadvantage of them is that they are limited in their size. If a larger ﬁscal
stimulus is deemed appropriate, then stimulus checks provide an alternative option that will
stimulate spending during the recession even if the welfare beneﬁts are substantially lower
than the UI extension.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we analyze how sensitive our results are to some of the parameters in the
model. In particular, we focus on parameters that heavily inﬂuence consumers’ incentives to
save. These parameters are (1) the interest rate that aﬀects the returns on saving and (2) the
degree of risk aversion and the replacement rates when unemployed with or without beneﬁts
that aﬀect the strength of a precautionary saving motive. The aim is to alter these incentives
while maintaining the requirement that the distributions of liquid wealth in each education
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
group match the distributions in the data. Hence, in each case, we re-estimate the
distributions of discount factors in each education group (and, if necessary, the degree of
splurge spending in consumption). The aim is thus to compute new results for a model with
diﬀerent parameters that also ﬁts data on the distribution of liquid wealth. At the end of the
section, we also consider how changing the properties of the recession aﬀects our main
results.

<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we repeat the welfare analysis conducted in section <a 
href="#x1-230004.3">4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:welfare --></a> for diﬀerent values of
the interest rate. As in that section, the stimulus check and payroll tax cut policy have been
adjusted to be of the same ﬁscal size as the UI extension. All three policies are implemented
during a recession. We determine welfare results for the policies implemented both with and
without aggregate demand eﬀects.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >  As can be seen in table <a 
href="#x1-28001r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:robustness_R_results --></a>, a higher interest rate increases the welfare beneﬁts of all three
policies. This result obtains despite only small changes in the multipliers for the diﬀerent
interest rates. Higher interest rates result in higher welfare beneﬁts, as measured in lifetime
consumption units, for all policies because the beneﬁts of the policies (in the numerator) are
front-loaded compared with a proportional increase in consumption through all periods
(in the denominator). Thus, increasing the interest rate—which is also the social
planner’s discount rate—reduces the value of a proportional increase in consumption by
more than the consumption increases associated with each policy. Nevertheless, the
qualitative result that the extended UI beneﬁts provide by far the highest welfare
gains, followed by the stimulus checks, is strongly robust to changes in the interest
rate.

makes the precautionary saving motive stronger for all consumers in that group.
Ceteris paribus, these consumers would then increase the amount of liquid wealth
they accumulate, and the median liquid-wealth-to-permanent-income ratio for the
education group would increase. For all the education groups, the discount factor
distributions are therefore centered around lower values of <img

Thus, to maintain the concentrated wealth distribution, <img

Dropout and College groups. The results are distributions of discount factors within these

When households are less risk averse, the model requires them to be more patient to

<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >  The strength of the precautionary saving motive is determined by more than just risk
aversion. The risks that households face also drive the strength of this motive for
saving, and in our model, a key risk is unemployment risk. The replacement rates
that households face when they are unemployed with or without beneﬁts play an
important role. In section <a

<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" >  A higher risk aversion implies a greater welfare loss associated with the same drop in
consumption, and thus, a greater welfare gain for policies that reduce the consumption drop.
However, changing the risk-aversion parameter has a number of other ramiﬁcations for
our welfare measure that are diﬃcult to assess without simulation. A higher risk
aversion (ceteris paribus) induces agents to hold a higher buﬀer stock of savings,
making them less sensitive to adverse economic shocks in terms of their consumption
response. As argued earlier, and since we target the empirical wealth-to-income ratios,
we increase impatience to counteract this larger incentive to save. These changes
then aﬀect the consumption response of agents to the recession and to the policies
implemented.

considerably higher welfare beneﬁts for the UI extension policy. In particular, the lower the

to the UI. The UI extension is thus particularly powerful if <img

mirrored by the 10y-horizon multiplier of the UI extension policy. It increases from 1.20

multipliers and welfare eﬀects of the other two policies do not change dramatically under
the alternative calibration. Again, our ranking of the three policies remains the

<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >In this section, we alter two properties of the recession and study the eﬀect of those changes
(one at a time) on our main results. First, we lower the average length of a recession from six
quarters in the baseline to four quarters. Second, we increase the consumption elasticity of the
aggregate demand eﬀect, <img 
src="HAFiscal235x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle">, from 0.3 in the baseline to 0.5. In either case, the parameter
changes do not require a re-estimation of the discount factor distribution, since the baseline
saving behavior is unaﬀected by properties of the recession, which arrives as an MIT
shock.
<!--l. 218--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-35001r13">13<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:robustness_recession_property_results --></a> presents the welfare results for diﬀerent properties of the recession. In case of a
shorter average recession length of four, instead of six, quarters, we observe lower
welfare eﬀects of the policies. As argued earlier, the reason is that the policies are
particularly eﬀective during recessions. With a shorter average recession length, the
additional spending induced by the policies is now less likely to occur while the
recession is ongoing. This outcome can also be seen by investigating the 10y-horizon
multipliers of the policies, which fall slightly for all three policies considered: from
1.245 in the baseline to 1.224 in case of the shorter recession length for the stimulus
check, from 1.200 to 1.180 for the UI extension, and from 0.999 to 0.967 for the tax
cut.
<!--l. 220--><p class="indent" >  A higher value for <img 
src="HAFiscal236x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle">—and hence stronger aggregate demand eﬀects—considerably
increases the welfare eﬀects of each policy. Of course, this is only the case in the version of the
model where the aggregate demand eﬀects are active. In their absence, there is no change in
the welfare results relative to the baseline calibration. The larger <img 
src="HAFiscal237x.svg" alt="κ  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> implies a larger boost to
aggregate income in response to the demand eﬀects of the policies. This larger boost
translates to a larger increase in consumption and thus a stronger welfare eﬀect.
Under stronger AD eﬀects, the policies also have considerably larger 10y-horizon
multipliers. The stimulus check exhibits a multiplier of 1.636 (baseline: 1.245); the
UI extension, a multiplier of 1.492 (1.200); and the tax cut, a multiplier of 1.152
(0.999).

 id="x1-360005.5"></a>Summary of robustness exercises</h4>
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >The robustness checks in this section show that our main results are robust to a wide range of
alternative parameter choices. A key step in the robustness exercises that directly aﬀect the
strength of the precautionary savings motive—changing the interest rate, the risk aversion
parameter, or the replacement rates in the unemployment system—is to reestimate the
distribution of discount rates. Thus, we aim to match the distribution of liquid wealth in each
case. This appears to more or less pin down the aggregate consumption properties for the
model, regardless of the other parameters. Importantly, none of the robustness checks alter the
ranking of policies in terms of their eﬀectiveness and therefore the overall conclusions of this
paper are unaﬀected.
<!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >  Characteristics of the recession do, however, matter for our results. Shorter recessions or
those with smaller aggregate demand eﬀects reduce the eﬀectiveness of policies. Conversely,
more severe recessions will render the policies even more eﬃcient than our baseline results
suggest.

  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6  </span> <a 
 id="x1-370006"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >For many years leading up to the Great Recession, a widely held view among macroeconomists
was that countercyclical policy should be left to central banks, because ﬁscal policy responses
were unpredictable in their timing, their content, and their eﬀects. Nevertheless, even during
this period, ﬁscal policy responses to recessions were repeatedly tried, perhaps because the
macroeconomists’ advice to policymakers, “don’t just do something; stand there”—is not
politically tenable.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >  This paper demonstrates that macroeconomic modeling has ﬁnally advanced to the point
where we can make reasonably credible assessments of the eﬀects of alternative policies of the
kinds that have been tried. The key developments have been both the advent of national
registry datasets that can measure crucial microeconomic phenomena and the creation of tools
of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic modeling that can match those micro facts and glean
their macroeconomic implications.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  We examine three ﬁscal policy experiments that have actually been implemented
in the past: an extension of UI beneﬁts, a stimulus check, and a tax cut on labor
income. Our model suggests that the extension of UI beneﬁts is a clear “bang for the
buck” winner. While the stimulus check arrives faster, it is less well targeted to
high-MPC households than an extension of UI beneﬁts and therefore has only a
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
mildly greater spending boost while the recession is ongoing (when multipliers are
likely to be strongest). By contrast, the welfare gains of extended UI beneﬁts are
signiﬁcantly greater than those of a stimulus check. The chief drawback of the UI
extension is that its size is limited by the fact that a relatively small share of the
population is aﬀected by it. In contrast, stimulus checks are easily scalable while
exhibiting only slightly less recession-period stimulus (in a typical recession). However,
since some of the stimulus checks ﬂow to well-oﬀ consumers, such checks do worse
than UI extensions when we evaluate welfare consequences. Finally, the payroll tax
cut is the least eﬀective in terms of both the multiplier and welfare eﬀect, since it
targets only employed consumers and, for a typical recession, more of its payouts
are likely to occur after the recessionary period (when multipliers may exist) has
ended.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  The tools we are using could be reasonably easily modiﬁed to evaluate a number of other
policies. For example, in the COVID-driven recession, not only was the duration of UI beneﬁts
extended, but those beneﬁts were also supplemented by substantial payments to all UI
recipients. We did not calibrate the model to match this particular policy, but the framework
could easily accommodate such an analysis.
