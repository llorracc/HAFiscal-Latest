B Results in a model without the splurge
In this appendix, we consider the implications for our results of removing splurge
consumption from the model. First, we discuss that model’s ability to match the
empirical targets that we used to estimate the splurge in section 3.1 of the paper. Second,
we repeat the estimation of discount factor distributions in the US model in section 3.3.3,
and discuss the implications for both targeted and untargeted moments. Finally, we use
the reestimated model to asses the relevance of the splurge for the effectiveness of the
three policies.

B.1 Matching the iMPCs without the splurge
For the purpose of evaluating the results in the model without the splurge we do not
require the reestimation of our Norwegian model, as the purpose of the latter is the
estimation of the splurge. Nevertheless, we test how well the model can match the
dynamics of spending after a temporary income shock as reported by ? when the splurge

Note: Panel (a) shows the fit of the model to the dynamic consumption response estimated in
?; see their figure A5. Panel (b) shows the fit of the model to the distribution of liquid wealth
(see Section 3.2 in the paper for the definition) from the 2004 SCF.

While the splurge helps in matching the empirical evidence on the iMPC, the model
without the splurge also performs relatively well. This is because the model without
the splurge is able to generate a high initial marginal propensity to consume through a
wider distribution of discount factors (β = 0.921 and ∇ = 0.116) relative to the model
with a splurge (β = 0.968 and ∇ = 0.0578). This ensures that sufficiently many agents
are at the borrowing constraint and thus sensitive to transitory income shocks.1
However, the model is not quite able to match the difference in spending between
the initial year of the lottery win and the year after. The model without the splurge
exhibits a higher spending propensity in the year after the shock occurs as borrowingconstrained agents spend the additional income quicker. The model without the splurge
also provides a worse fit of the distribution of liquid wealth. Relative to the baseline
model, and to the data, the model without a splurge generates a more unequal wealth
distribution.
The reason for these two effects, becomes apparent when considering the crosssectional implications of the models with and without the splurge across different
wealth quartiles. While the model with the splurge can account for the empiricallyobserved initial MPCs among the wealthiest, the model without the splurge exhibits
much lower MPCs among that group, see Table 1. The wealthiest group will thus
1 The model without the splurge implies there is a group of highly impatient households who have discount rates close
to 0.8. While this is possible, such a discount rate implies these households care very little about their consumption even
just a few years in the future.

be very patient and have low MPCs, which can explain why the wealth distribution
becomes more unequal and doesn’t quite fit the targeted distribution in the data in the
version of the model without the splurge.
Overall, the model fit with the data deteriorates roughly by a factor of two measured
by the Euclidean norm of the targeting error.2

B.2 Estimating discount factor distributions without the splurge
Figure 2 shows that the model without splurge consumption can also match the wealth
distributions in the three education groups very well. We therefore turn to the implications of this version of the model for the untargeted moments discussed in section 3.3.4.
The main difference between the models with and without splurge consumption is
that without splurge consumption the MPCs drop for each education group and wealth
quartile. The difference is largest for the College group and for the highest wealth
quartile (obviously with substantial overlap between these two groups). This is shown
in the two panels in Table 2. The rest of the table shows that the distribution of wealth
is not substantially different in the model estimated without splurge consumption.
Finally, we again consider the implications of our model for the dynamics of spending
over time and for the dynamics of spending for households that remain unemployed long
enough for unemployment benefits to expire. Figure 3 repeats Figure 3 in the paper with
results from the model without splurge consumption added. The implication is that the
model without a splurge leads to a slightly too low MPC in the year of a lottery win
and a slightly higher MPC in the year after.
The drop in spending when unemployment benefits expire is virtually the same in
the model without splurge consumption (17 percent versus 18 percent in the baseline).
While the consumption dynamics across the models with and without a splurge are fairly
similar, the underlying drivers of the consumption drop upon expiry of unemployment
benefits are different. In the model with the splurge, the drop in income translates
directly into lower consumption via the splurge itself. In the model without the splurge
it is the sharp rise in agents hitting the borrowing constraint which accounts for the
2 Specifically, the Euclidean norm of the targeting error increases from 0.04 to 0.08 for the time-profile of the marginal
propensity to consume when the splurge is removed, from 0.16 to 0.29 for the marginal propensity to consume across
wealth quartiles and from 0.027 to 0.032 for the Lorentz curve.

consumption drop after UI benefits expire. This is shown in the solid and dashed red
lines in Figure 3b, and is due to the wider distribution of discount factors that is needed
to match the wealth distributions in the model without the splurge. This leads to a
greater number of agents being close the borrowing constraint.

The MPCs are calculated for each individual for the year of a lottery win, taking into account
that the win takes place in a random quarter of the year that differs across individuals. The
MPCs are averaged across individuals within each education group. Panel (B) shows the same

B.3 Multipliers in the absence of the splurge
In this section we simulate the three fiscal policies from the main text in the estimated
model without the splurge. The shape of the impulse response functions only marginally
change relative to the model with the splurge. Hence, we focus on the quantitative
changes as summarized by the cumulative multipliers in Figure 4. The figure shows the
multipliers when AD effects are switched on for the model with and without the splurge.
Table 3 shows the 10y-horizon multiplier across the two models.
The absence of the splurge entails a calibration with a lower average MPC in the
population. Hence, the check and tax cut exhibit lower multipliers when there is no
splurge. For the UI extension we observe the opposite pattern, as the multiplier is larger
in the model without the splurge. This due to the consumption dynamics around the
expiry of UI benefits described in the previous section. In the model without the splurge
more agents hit the borrowing constraint upon the expiry of benefits. Providing those
agents with an extension of UI benefits thus turns out to be slightly more powerful.
The policy ranking in terms of the multiplier shifts slighlty. In the model with the
splurge, the check policy delivers multiplier effects much more rapidly than the UI
extension. In the model without splurge consumption, the UI extension appears superior
to the check, both at shorter and longer horizons. Both models agree on the tax cut
being the least effective policy.
