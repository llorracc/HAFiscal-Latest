               expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of unemployment
               insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and empirical analyses
               emphasize the importance of allowing for the fact that households
               buy durable as well as non-durable goods. The theoretical
               analysis shows that in the short run households can cut back
               significantly on total expenditures without a significant fall in
               welfare if they concentrate their budget reductions on durables.
               We then present an empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey
               of workers who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes
               in the unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
               show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
               expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
               expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
               expenditures may be non-separable from employment status. The
               effects we find are particularly strong for households with no
               liquid assets before the spell started. These qualitative
               findings are in precise agreement with the theoretical

               monthly purchases and lumpy expenditure spikes. Memorable goods
               expenditures are 20\% the size of nondurable expenditures, but
               three times as volatile. We then develop a consumption-savings

               the recession that began in 2007 represents the deepest downturn
               in the postwar era. Early on, the nature of labor market
               adjustment displayed a notable resemblance to that observed in
               past severe downturns. During the latter half of 2009, however,
               the path of adjustment exhibited important departures from that
               seen during and after prior deep recessions. Recent data point to
               two warning signs going forward. First, the record rise in
               long-term unemployment may yield a persistent residue of
               long-term unemployed workers with weak search effectiveness.
               Second, conventional estimates suggest that the extension of
               Emergency Unemployment Compensation may have led to a modest
               increase in unemployment. Despite these forces, we conclude that
               the problems facing the U.S. labor market are unlikely to be as

              the reduced duration of unemployment in creating the educational

               statistics approach, I show that the welfare loss from excess
               sensitivity depends on the MPC and the relative payment size as a
               fraction of income. Since the lump-sum payments do not depend on
               income, the two statistics are negatively correlated such that
               the welfare losses are similar across households and small (less
               than 0.1\% of wealth), despite the large MPCs.",

               and unemployment, as well as business cycles that are inefficient

               We derive an augmented Baily--Chetty formula showing that the
               optimal generosity of the social insurance system depends on a
               macroeconomic stabilization term. This term pushes for an
               increase in generosity when the level of economic activity is
               more responsive to social programmes in recessions than in booms.
               A calibration to the US economy shows that taking concerns for
               macroeconomic stabilization into account substantially raises the
               optimal unemployment insurance replacement rate but has a
               negligible impact on the optimal progressivity of the income tax.

               to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United
               States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are
               consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the
               annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
               the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models
               (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises
               because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong
               precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts that the
               aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is
               distributed across households (depending, e.g., on their wealth,
               or employment status).",

               based on the notion of Dynamic Stochastic weights, or DS-weights
               for short. We leverage DS-weights to characterize three sets of
               results. First, we develop an additive decomposition of aggregate
               welfare assessments that satisfies desirable properties. We show
               that, for a large class of dynamic stochastic economies with
               heterogeneous individuals, welfare assessments can be exactly
               decomposed into four components: i) aggregate efficiency, ii)
               risk-sharing, iii) intertemporal-sharing, and iv) redistribution.
               Second, we introduce the notion of normalized welfarist planners,
               which allows us to revisit how welfarist (e.g., utilitarian)
               planners make interpersonal welfare comparisons in consumption

               Typically, to receive two weeks of liquidity from these loans

               7000\%. Using an administrative dataset from a payday lender, we
               seek to explain demand-side behavior in the payday loan market.

               standard features like liquidity constraints and stochastic
               income, and we also incorporate institutionally realistic payday
               loans, default opportunities, and generalizations of the discount
               function. Method of Simulated Moments estimates of the key
               parameters are identi\ldots{}ed by two novel pieces of evidence.
               First, over half of payday borrowers default on a payday loan

               payday loans, making interest payments of 90\% of their original

               the largest stimulus package in history. In the United States it

              in recent U.S. recessions. How large must checks be to close a
              given share of the output gap? How much is too much? In answering
              these questions, we recognize that households' marginal propensity
              to spend (MPC) out of stimulus checks varies with their size.
              Lumpy purchases of consumer durables are central to this
              size-dependence. We augment a canonical model of durable spending
              by introducing a smooth adjustment hazard. This specification can
              accomodate a decreasing, flat, or increasing MPC. We discipline
              the adjustment hazard by matching the evidence on (i) the relative
              MPCs of durables and non-durables; (ii) the short-run price
              elasticity of durables; (iii) the size distribution of
              adjustments; and (iv) the conditional probability of adjustment
              since the last purchase. We find that the MPC remains elevated
              even for large stimulus checks. In a typical recession, the
              stimulus check that closes half the output gap is half as large
              compared to a canonical model of non-durables with the same MPC
              out of a small transfer, and three times larger compared to a

               we extend a model that matches responses to past consumption
               stimulus packages. The extension allows us to account for two
               novel features of the coronavirus crisis. First, during
               lockdowns, many types of spending are undesirable or impossible.
               Second, some of the jobs that disappear during the lockdown will
               not reappear. We estimate that, if the lockdown is short-lived
               (the median point of view as we are writing in April 2020), the
               combination of expanded unemployment insurance benefits and
               stimulus payments should be sufficient to allow a swift recovery
               in consumer spending to precrisis levels. If the lockdown lasts
               longer (or there is a `second wave'), an extension of enhanced
               unemployment benefits will likely be necessary for consumption
               spending to recover quickly.",

               experiments, finds that 20-40 percent of fiscal stimulus payments
               (e.g. tax rebates) are spent on non-durable household consumption
               in the quarter that they are received. We develop a structural
               economic model to interpret this evidence. Our model integrates
               the classical Baumol-Tobin model of money demand into the
               workhorse incomplete-markets life-cycle economy. In this
               framework, households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid
               asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid
               asset (e.g., housing, retirement account) that carries a
               transaction cost. The optimal life-cycle pattern of wealth
               accumulation implies that many households are ``wealthy
               hand-to-mouth'': they hold little or no liquid wealth despite
               owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. They therefore
               display large propensities to consume out of additional income.
               We document the existence of such households in data from the
               Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parametrized
               to the 2001 tax rebate episode is able to generate consumption

               over-optimistic about how soon they will repay. We measure
               borrowers' present focus and over-optimism using an experiment
               with a large payday lender. Although the most inexperienced
               quartile of borrowers under-estimate their likelihood of future
               borrowing, the more experienced three quartiles predict correctly
               on average. This finding contrasts sharply with priors we
               elicited from 103 payday lending and behavioural economics
               experts, who believed that the average borrower would be highly
               overoptimistic about getting out of debt. Borrowers are willing
               to pay a significant premium for an experimental incentive to
               avoid future borrowing, which we show implies that they perceive
               themselves to be time inconsistent. We use borrowers' predicted
               behaviour and valuation of the experimental incentive to estimate
               a model of present focus and naivete. We then use the model to
               study common payday lending regulations. In our model, banning
               payday loans reduces welfare relative to existing regulation,
               while limits on repeat borrowing might increase welfare by
               inducing faster repayment that is more consistent with long-run

  abstract  = "Abstract Recent literature has shown that the fraction of
               liquidity-constrained households in the population critically
               determines the mix of transmission channels of monetary policy.
               In this article, we bring a different but important dimension of
               heterogeneity to the forefront: stock market participation. We
               show that the stock market participation rate not only shapes the
               mix of policy channels but also heavily affects the aggregate
               responses. This happens as direct rebalancing effects and
               indirect equilibrium effects into investment are both increasing
               in the number of stock market participants, reinforcing each
               other. We show this in a quantitative New Keynesian model
               designed to account for the population share of stock market
               participants, their position in the income and wealth
               distribution, and their saving rates. The model implies that, as
               stock market participation has increased since the 1980s, the
               power of monetary policy on the real economy has strengthened
               considerably.",

               household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify
               and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the US Great
               Recession of 2007--09 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
               from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns
               of household income, consumption, and wealth inequality before
               and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how
               households in different segments of the wealth distribution were
               affected by income declines, and how they changed their
               expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn.
               Motivated by this evidence, we study several variants of a
               standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and
               an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
               finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the
               impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the distribution
               features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very
               little net worth that sharply increase their saving (ie, they are
               not hand-to mouth) as the recession hits. We document that both
               these features are observed in the PSID. We also investigate the
               role that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
               insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
               distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.",

               formation institutions. Wages are subject to a downward nominal
               wage rigidity (DNWR). Inspired by many countries' fiscal policy
               responses to the Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
               investigate the model's ability to generate state-dependent
               fiscal multipliers. We find, that both the zero lower bound on
               nominal interest rates and DNWR individually can account for
               higher fiscal multipliers during recessions. In joint presence,
               however, the existence of DNWR reduces the multiplier at the ZLB.
               Moreover, the DNWR significantly relaxes the paradox of toil at
               the ZLB. We show that the state-dependency is robust to
               alternative assumptions about the origin of the recession, the
