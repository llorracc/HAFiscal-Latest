               circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut back on
               expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of unemployment
               insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and empirical analyses
               emphasize the importance of allowing for the fact that households
               buy durable as well as non-durable goods. The theoretical
               analysis shows that in the short run households can cut back
               significantly on total expenditures without a significant fall in
               welfare if they concentrate their budget reductions on durables.
               We then present an empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey
               of workers who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes
               in the unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
               show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
               expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
               expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
               expenditures may be non-separable from employment status. The
               effects we find are particularly strong for households with no
               liquid assets before the spell started. These qualitative
               findings are in precise agreement with the theoretical
               predictions. (JEL: D11, D12, D91, J65)",

               (MPCs) vary with household characteristics and shock size. We
               find that spending peaks in the year of winning and gradually
               reverts to normal within five years. Controlling for all items on
               households' balance sheets and characteristics such as education

               monthly purchases and lumpy expenditure spikes. Memorable goods
               expenditures are 20\% the size of nondurable expenditures, but
               three times as volatile. We then develop a consumption-savings

              in recent U.S. recessions. How large must checks be to close a
              given share of the output gap? How much is too much? In answering
              these questions, we recognize that households' marginal propensity
              to spend (MPC) out of stimulus checks varies with their size.
              Lumpy purchases of consumer durables are central to this
              size-dependence. We augment a canonical model of durable spending
              by introducing a smooth adjustment hazard. This specification can
              accomodate a decreasing, flat, or increasing MPC. We discipline
              the adjustment hazard by matching the evidence on (i) the relative
              MPCs of durables and non-durables; (ii) the short-run price
              elasticity of durables; (iii) the size distribution of
              adjustments; and (iv) the conditional probability of adjustment
              since the last purchase. We find that the MPC remains elevated
              even for large stimulus checks. In a typical recession, the
              stimulus check that closes half the output gap is half as large
              compared to a canonical model of non-durables with the same MPC
              out of a small transfer, and three times larger compared to a

               estimating general equilibrium heterogeneous-agent models with
               aggregate shocks in discrete time. Our approach relies on the
               rapid computation ofsequence-space Jacobians--the derivatives of
               perfect-foresight equilibrium mappings between aggregate
               sequences around the steady state. Our main contribution is a
               fast algorithm for calculating Jacobians for a large class of
               heterogeneous-agent problems. We combine this algorithm with a
               systematic approach to composing and inverting Jacobians to solve
               for general equilibrium impulse responses. We obtain a rapid
               procedure for likelihood-based estimation and computation of
               nonlinear perfect-foresight transitions. We apply our methods to
               three canonical heterogeneous-agent models: a neoclassical model,
               a New Keynesian model with one asset, and a New Keynesian model
               with two assets.",

               and quantifies the macro implications of consumption
               heterogeneity. We propose a new empirical method to estimate the
               response of consumption to permanent and transitory income shocks
               for different groups of households. We then apply this method to
               administrative data from Denmark. The large sample size, along
               with detailed household balance sheet information, allows us to
               finely divide the population along relevant dimensions. We find
               that households that stand to lose from an interest rate hike are
               significantly more responsive to income shocks than those that
               stand to gain. Following a 1-percentage-point interest rate
               increase, we estimate that consumption growth decreases by a 1/4
               percentage point through this interest rate exposure channel
               alone, making this channel substantially larger than the
               intertemporal substitution channel that is at the core of
               representative agent New Keynesian models.",

               to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United

               consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the
               annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
               the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models
               (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises
               because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a strong
               precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts that the
               aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the shock is
               distributed across households (depending, e.g., on their wealth,

              Second, we introduce the notion of normalized welfarist planners,

               the largest stimulus package in history. In the United States it

               payments to households. To the extent that such transfers were
               (i) announced in advance and (ii) conditional on recipients being
               unemployed, they mitigated income risk associated with the
               lockdown--in contrast to unconditional transfers. We develop a
               baseline scenario for a COVID-19 recession in a medium-scale
               heterogeneous agent new Keynesian model and use counterfactuals

              in recent U.S. recessions. How large must checks be to close a
              given share of the output gap? How much is too much? In answering
              these questions, we recognize that households' marginal propensity
              to spend (MPC) out of stimulus checks varies with their size.
              Lumpy purchases of consumer durables are central to this
              size-dependence. We augment a canonical model of durable spending
              by introducing a smooth adjustment hazard. This specification can
              accomodate a decreasing, flat, or increasing MPC. We discipline
              the adjustment hazard by matching the evidence on (i) the relative
              MPCs of durables and non-durables; (ii) the short-run price
              elasticity of durables; (iii) the size distribution of
              adjustments; and (iv) the conditional probability of adjustment
              since the last purchase. We find that the MPC remains elevated
              even for large stimulus checks. In a typical recession, the
              stimulus check that closes half the output gap is half as large
              compared to a canonical model of non-durables with the same MPC
              out of a small transfer, and three times larger compared to a

               (e.g. tax rebates) are spent on non-durable household consumption
               in the quarter that they are received. We develop a structural
               economic model to interpret this evidence. Our model integrates
               the classical Baumol-Tobin model of money demand into the
               workhorse incomplete-markets life-cycle economy. In this
               framework, households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid
               asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid
               asset (e.g., housing, retirement account) that carries a
               transaction cost. The optimal life-cycle pattern of wealth
               accumulation implies that many households are ``wealthy
               hand-to-mouth'': they hold little or no liquid wealth despite
               owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. They therefore
               display large propensities to consume out of additional income.
               We document the existence of such households in data from the
               Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parametrized
               to the 2001 tax rebate episode is able to generate consumption

               and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the US Great
               Recession of 2007--09 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
               from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document the patterns
               of household income, consumption, and wealth inequality before
               and during the Great Recession. We then investigate how
               households in different segments of the wealth distribution were
               affected by income declines, and how they changed their
               expenditures differentially during the aggregate downturn.
               Motivated by this evidence, we study several variants of a
               standard heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and
               an endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
               finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify the
               impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the distribution
               features a sufficiently large fraction of households with very
               little net worth that sharply increase their saving (ie, they are
               not hand-to mouth) as the recession hits. We document that both
