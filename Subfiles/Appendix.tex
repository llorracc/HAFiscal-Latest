\section{Linearity of the check multiplier}

Table \ref{multipliers_checklinearity} shows the amount of additional consumption stimulated (as \% of baseline consumption) caused by stimulus checks of different sizes as well as their net-present value multiplier. The table shows that the impact of the check stimulus experiment scales roughly linearly with the size of the stimulus check, leaving the multiplier largely unaffected by the size of check.
