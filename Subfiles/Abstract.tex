Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match dynamics of the Marginal Propensity to Consume, we evaluate three fiscal stimulus policies tried during recent recessions.  Unemployment Insurance extensions are the clear `bang for the buck' winner, especially when the policies are evaluated with a welfare criterion that aggregates microeconomic utilities.  `Stimulus checks' are second best, and have the advantage of being easilly scalable to any desired size.  A sustained (but not permanent) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less effective than the other policies, and has negligible benefits in the version of our model without a multiplier.
