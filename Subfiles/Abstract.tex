Using a heterogeneous agent model calibrated to match the initial MPC and subsequent spending dynamics over four years, we assess the effectiveness of three fiscal stimulus policies employed during recent recessions.  Unemployment Insurance (UI) extensions are the clear `bang for the buck' winner, especially when effectiveness is measured in utility terms.  `Stimulus checks' are second best, and have the advantage (over UI) of being scalable to any desired size.  A temporary (two year) cut in the rate of wage taxation is considerably less effective than the other policies, and has negligible benefits in the version of our model without a multiplier.
